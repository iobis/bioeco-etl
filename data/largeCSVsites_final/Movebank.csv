In the Southern Ocean, there is an extensive fishery for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba that is projected to increase further. Comparing distribution and prey selection of fishing operations versus predators is needed to predict fishery-related impacts on krill-dependent predators. In this context, it is important to consider not only predators breeding near the fishing grounds but also the ones breeding far away and that disperse during the non-breeding season where they may interact with fisheries. In this study, we first quantified the overlap between the distribution of the Antarctic krill fisheries and the distribution of a krill dependent seabird, the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, during both the breeding and non-breeding season. We tracked birds from the world biggest Antarctic petrel colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land), located >1000 km from the main fishing areas, during three consecutive seasons. The overall spatial overlap between krill fisheries and Antarctic petrels was limited but varied greatly among and within years, and was high in some periods during the non-breeding season. In a second step, we described the length frequency distribution of Antarctic krill consumed by Antarctic petrels, and compared this with results from fisheries, as well as from diet studies in other krill predators. Krill taken by Antarctic petrels did not differ in size from that taken by trawls or from krill taken by most Antarctic krill predators. Selectivity for specific Antarctic krill stages seems generally low in Antarctic predators. Overall, our results show that competition between Antarctic petrels and krill fisheries is currently likely negligible. However, if krill fisheries are to increase in the future, competition with the Antarctic petrel may occur, even with birds breeding thousands of kilometers away.

own condition, avoid predators and ultimately increase their fitness. Using accelerometers and GPS loggers,
features of the habitat and the way animals deal with variable conditions can be translated into energetic costs
of movement, which, in turn, can be translated to energy landscapes.We investigated energy landscapes in
Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua from two colonies at New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands.
Results: In our study, the marine areas used by the penguins, parameters of dive depth and the proportion of
pelagic and benthic dives varied both between years and colonies. As a consequence, the energy landscapes also
varied between the years, and we discuss how this was related to differences in food availability, which were also
reflected in differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and isotopic niche metrics. In the second year,
the energy landscape was characterized by lower foraging costs per energy gain, and breeding success was also
higher in this year. Additionally, an area around three South American Fur Seal Arctocephalus australis colonies was
never used.
Conclusions: These results confirm that energy landscapes vary in time and that the seabirds forage in areas of the
energy landscapes that result in minimized energetic costs. Thus, our results support the view of energy landscapes
and fear of predation as mechanisms underlying animal foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we show that energy
landscapes are useful in linking energy gain and variable energy costs of foraging to breeding success.

Behav.: Many animals show sex differences in foraging behaviour, which can be related to sex-specific size
dimorphism, avoidance of intersexual competition for depletable resources or different energetic
requirements of males and females. In southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, both sexes
differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We
therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during
the incubation period, using GPS and timeedepth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated
weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used
coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition
between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and
ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental
conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt
models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have
slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature.
The different energetic requirements related to the birds’ incubation and chick-provisioning pattern
seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly
productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for
themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage.

PLoS One:
Logger technology has revolutionised our knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of free-living animals but handling
and logger attachments may have negative effects on the behaviour of the animals and their welfare. We studied southern
rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) females during the guard stage in three consecutive breeding seasons (2008/
0922010/11) to evaluate the effects of handling and logger attachment on foraging trip duration, dive behaviour and
physiological parameters. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used
in all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were
previously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study.
Increased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also
found GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding
seasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact
of logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies
with birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower. Mean and maximum dive depths were similar between GPS
and TDR birds. We measured little impact of logger attachments on physiological parameters (corticosterone, protein,
triglyceride levels and leucocyte counts). Overall, handling and short-term logger attachments (1–3 days) showed limited
impact on the behaviour and physiology of the birds but care must be taken with the size of data loggers on diving
seabirds. Increased drag may alter their diving behaviour substantially, thus constraining them in their ability to catch prey.
Results obtained in this study indicate that data recorded may also not represent their normal dive behaviour.",research,NA,FALSE,13:35.0,10:36.0,48644,Eudyptes chrysocome,GPS

This foraging strategy makes the penguins particularly susceptible to set net operations that go after dogfish or school shark at the seafloor. Yellow-eyed penguin numbers are currently in free fall all along the mainland with climate change and fisheries interactions being suspected to play an important role in the current trends. However, the accurate assessment of fisheries impacts is hampered by a lack of data of the penguins’ utilization of the marine habitat. While some tracking work has been conducted in the past few years, our understanding of the penguins’ foraging ranges throughout the year is extremely limited.

A basic understanding of crested penguins’ pre-moult dispersal is therefore paramount in order to be able to assess factors affecting individual survival. The Fiordland penguin, or Tawaki, the only crested penguin species breeding on the New Zealand mainland, is currently one of the least studied and rarest penguin species in the world. We successfully satellite tracked the pre-moult dispersal of 17 adult Tawaki from a single colony located in the species’ northern breeding distribution. Over the course of 8–10 weeks the penguins travelled up to 2,500 km away from their breeding colony, covering total swimming distances of up to 6,800 km. During outbound travels all penguins headed south-west within a well-defined corridor before branching out towards two general trip destinations. Birds leaving in late November travelled towards the Subtropical Front some 800 km south of Tasmania, whereas penguins that left in December headed further towards the subantarctic front. Using K-select analysis we examined the influence of oceanographic factors on the penguins’ dispersal. Water depth, surface current velocity and sea level anomalies had the greatest influence on penguin movements at the subantarctic Front, while sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration were key for birds travelling to the subtropical front. We discuss our findings in the light of anthropogenic activities (or lack thereof) in the regions visited by the penguins as well as the potential consequences of Tawaki pre-moult dispersal for the species’ breeding distribution on the New Zealand mainland.",research,NA,FALSE,22:59.0,56:30.0,3774,Eudyptes pachyrhynchus,Argos Doppler Shift

As a consequence of the links between biomes mediated by migrants, changes in one biome could affect remote areas in unpredictable ways. Migratory routes and timing of most Neotropical austral migrants, which breed at south temperate latitudes of South America and overwinter closer to or within tropical latitudes of South America, have yet to be described in detail. As a result, our understanding about how these birds provide links between South American biomes is almost non-existent. White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps chilensis) is a long-distance austral migrant that breeds in the Patagonian Forest biome and overwinters in tropical South America. Because this small flycatcher plays a key role in the regeneration of this ecosystem, our objective was to describe the annual cycle of White-crested elaenias to evaluate the degree of migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering areas and therefore to determine if there are specific biomes of northern South America linked by elaenias to Patagonian forests. Fifteen individuals were successfully tracked throughout a complete migration cycle using miniature light-level geolocators. All individuals resided and moved through the same general regions. During fall (March-April-May), elaenias were located in the Caatinga and the Atlantic Forest biomes, from Rio de Janeiro to the region near Salvador da Bahia, Brazil. During winter (June-July-Aug), birds were located further inland, within the Cerrado biome. Birds used three different routes during fall migration. Our results indicate that some individuals use a direct route, flying between 500-600 km/day, crossing desert and grasslands, while others took a detour, flying 100-200 km/day through forested areas with refueling opportunities. All birds used the Yunga forest during spring migration, with ten out 15 individuals showing a clear counterclockwise loop trajectories throughout their annual cycle. None of the elaenias passed through Amazonia, traveled to western South America or crossed the Equator. Eleanias exhibited a high migratory connectivity between breeding area in Patagonian Forests and winter areas, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. Our results suggest that Patagonian Forests could be strongly impacted by changes in those biomes or in the Yungas.",research,NA,FALSE,08:00.0,32:00.0,7361,Elaenia albiceps,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw"

We worked with citizen scientists to track 925 pet cats from six countries, finding remarkably small home ranges (3.6 ± 5.6 ha). Only three cats ranged > 1 km^2 and we found no relationship between home range size and the presence of larger native predators (i.e. coyotes, Canis latrans). Most (75%) cats used primarily (90%) disturbed habitats. Owners reported that their pets killed an average of 3.5 prey items/month, leading to an estimated ecological impact per cat of 14.2‐38.9 prey ha^−1 yr^−1. This is similar or higher than the per‐animal ecological impact of wild carnivores but the effect is amplified by the high density of cats in neighborhoods.

Broad-scale habitat fragmentation is a visible result of human land-use throughout the world, often resulting in deleterious ecological outcomes. The ability of fauna to persist in fragmented landscapes is influenced by their capacity to move and access important resources such as food, water and shelter. When resources are depleted and spatially heterogeneous, identifying high quality habitat patches and understanding how individuals move through the landscape is critical for effective faunal conservation and management.

Phillip Island, located south of Australia, is a highly modified and fragmented landscape that contains patches of native vegetation amongst a matrix of agricultural farmland and urban developments. The island supports an abundant population of swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor), but little is known about how individuals move through this landscape. 
We developed and tested an inexpensive custom-made GPS wildlife tracker that sends data via the mobile phone network. High-resolution movement data gained from the trackers enabled us to highlights features that facilitate movement and others that represent barriers. Further we modelled how wallabies select resources within the landscape and move both within and between patches. Information about movement patterns and resource selection generated by the analysis will inform and improve the management of swamp wallabies in human-modified and fragmented landscapes and more generally enhance our understanding of the challenges faced by fauna in changing environments worldwide.

Whereas the first two performed foraging flights and returned to the colony after about a two weeks absence, the last traveled north for four weeks, suggesting that it had started migration towards the wintering grounds in the northern hemisphere. Faster travel speeds during the day than during the night were found for all three birds. A major foraging zone was located about 250–300 km north of Isla Mocha and close to the Chilean mainland.

Reasons for this are unknown but thought to relate to human interference (set nets) and habitat degradation and or shifts in prey species. Reversing this trend of declining numbers is hampered by a lack of information on foraging behaviour and preferred diet. 
The aim of this research is to describe the foraging behaviour and contemporary and historic diets of spotted shags.  These data will feed conservation policy focussing on marine protection for the species within the Auckland region into the future.
Specific aims of this research are:
1)	Identify foraging areas for spotted shags by GPS tracking and time depth recorder analysis of breeding adults within the Hauraki Gulf.
2)	Characterise the diet of this species through analysis of diet samples and through stable isotopes obtained through collection of feathers and blood.
The outcome of this research is to improve and optimise conservation efforts for spotted shags.

A standard practice for mammalian surveys is to place cameras on roads, trails, and paths to maximize detections and/or increase efficiency in the field. However, for many species it is unclear whether track‐based camera surveys provide reliable estimates of population density. (2) Understanding how the spatial arrangement of camera traps affects population density estimates is of key interest to contemporary conservationists and managers given the rapid increase in camera‐based wildlife surveys. (3) We evaluated the effect of camera‐trap placement, using several survey designs, on density estimates of a widespread mesopredator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, over a two‐year period in a semi‐arid conservation reserve in south‐eastern Australia. Further, we used the certainty in the identity and whereabouts of individuals (via GPS collars) to assess how resighting rates of marked foxes affect density estimates using maximum likelihood spatially explicit mark–resight methods. (4) Fox detection rates were much higher at cameras placed on tracks compared with off‐track cameras, yet in the majority of sessions, camera placement had relatively little effect on point estimates of density. However, for each survey design, the precision of density estimates varied considerably across sessions, influenced heavily by the absolute number of marked foxes detected, the number of times marked foxes was resighted, and the number of detection events of unmarked foxes. (5) Our research demonstrates that the precision of population density estimates using spatially explicit mark–resight models is sensitive to resighting rates of identifiable individuals. Nonetheless, camera surveys based either on‐ or off‐track can provide reliable estimates of population density using spatially explicit mark–resight models. This underscores the importance of incorporating information on the spatial behavior of the subject species when planning camera‐trap surveys.",research,NA,FALSE,40:39.0,40:36.0,94187,Vulpes vulpes,GPS

Our understanding, however, of the strategies used in pursuit and evasion remains limited. Here we report on the hunting dynamics of the world’s fastest land animal, the cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus. Using miniaturized data loggers, we recorded fine-scale movement, speed and acceleration of free-ranging cheetahs to measure how hunting dynamics relate to chasing different sized prey. Cheetahs attained hunting speeds of up to 18.94 m/s and accelerated up to 7.5 m/s2 with greatest angular velocities achieved during the terminal phase of the hunt. The interplay between forward and lateral acceleration during chases showed that the total forces involved in speed changes and turning were approximately constant over time but varied with prey type. Thus, rather than a simple maximum speed chase, cheetahs first accelerate to decrease the distance to their prey, before reducing speed 5-8 s from the end of the hunt, so as to facilitate rapid turns to match prey escape tactics, varying the precise strategy according to prey species. Predator and prey thus pit a fine balance of speed against manoeuvring capability in a race for survival.",research,NA,FALSE,16:02.0,53:40.0,35308,Acinonyx jubatus,GPS

Thermal stress is a major concern for large mammals, especially for savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), which have amongst the greatest challenge for heat dissipation in hot and arid environments. Therefore, elephants must make decisions about where and how fast to move to reduce thermal stress. We tracked 14 herds of elephant in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, for 2 years, using GPS collars with inbuilt temperature sensors to examine the influence of temperature on movement strategies, particularly when accessing water. We first confirmed that collar-mounted temperature loggers captured hourly variation in relative ambient temperatures across the landscape, and, thus, could be used to predict elephant movement strategies at fine spatio-temporal scales. We found that elephants moved slower in more densely wooded areas, but, unexpectedly, moved faster at higher temperatures, especially in the wet season compared to the dry season. Notably, this speed of movement was highest when elephants were approaching and leaving water sources. Visits to water showed a periodic shuttling pattern, with a peak return rate of 10–30 h, wherein elephants were closest to water during the hotter times of the day, and spent longer at water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. When elephants left water, they showed low fidelity to the same water source, and traveled farther in the dry season than in the wet season. In KNP, where water is easily accessible, and the risk of poaching is low, we found that elephants use short, high-speed bursts of movement to get to water at hotter times of day. This strategy not only provides the benefit of predation risk avoidance, but also allows them to use water to thermoregulate. We demonstrate that ambient temperature is an important predictor of movement and water use across the landscape, with elephants responding facultatively to a “landscape of thermal stress.""",research,NA,FALSE,30:00.0,30:00.0,283688,Loxodonta africana,GPS

These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. We examined the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity of intraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, as spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but during periods of resource limitation (dry season), also rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas) especially in the dry season. Leopard and cheetah overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviours and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. The smallest species (African wild dog) avoided lions and used multiple tactics to minimise encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially-explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.",research,NA,FALSE,23:00.0,47:00.0,35723,"Panthera leo,Panthera pardus,Acinonyx jubatus,Lycaon pictus",Radio Transmitter

Changes in reporting rates from bird atlas surveys suggest declines of up to 60 % over the last 20 years (1987-1982 vs. 2007-2013) across South Africa. Worryingly, large protected areas were not immune to these declines. For instance reporting rates in Kruger National Park (KNP; ca. 20,000 km2), an area often considered a stronghold for Martial Eagles, recorded a 54 % decline in reporting rates. It is not clear what the major drivers of declines have been in South Africa, nor what is contributing to the declines in these large protected areas. In this study we investigate the ecology of Martial Eagles in KNP to improve our understanding of the threats they face and how these threats at various stages in their life cycle may be driving declines within protected areas where one would expect that the species should be well conserved.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,00:00.0,44285,Polemaetus bellicosus,GPS

We radio tracked water opossums and collected information about their habitats and behaviour from October 2004 to April 2010. We combined common home range estimators for animals living in linear habitats with the synoptic model of home range and habitat selection. For the 10 individuals monitored, the home ranges varied between 0.80 and 9.66 km of watercourses; none of them had exclusive home ranges. The home range size for males was, on average, three times larger than for females. The overlap data showed that, on average, one male could encompass the home ranges of up to five females simultaneously, but more than one male could have access to the same female. For habitat selection at the individual level, we could not find any strong influence of habitat features on water opossum preferences because individuals selected different sets of habitat variables. However, at the population level, we found a negative relationship between home range size and river size. The water opossum seems to prefer shallow and narrow watercourses to establish its home ranges.

Natural populations are not homogenous systems, but sets of individuals that use subsets of the species’ niche. This phenomenon is known as individual specialization. Recently, several studies found evidence of individual specialization, mainly among animals. Although diet and use of space are intrinsically connected to one another, studies on individual specialization have seldom assessed the latter.
2. Our goal is to help fill this gap in knowledge by testing individual specialization using yellow–shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium) as a model and the new movement ecology paradigm as a framework.
3. First, we modeled as a network a system formed by individual bats and the landscape elements used by them. Second, to calculate overlap in individual activity areas as a proxy for specialization we developed a novel metric, the spatial individual specialization index (SpatIS). Finally, we tested fruit availability as a driver of interindividual differences in use of space. Ten individual bats were radio tracked in a heterogeneous Brazilian savanna. The density of their main food–plants was estimated and the number of activity points of each individual was counted.
4. There was large interindividual variation in the use of space not explained by sex or weight. Thus, our results point to individual specialization in the use of space in the studied population of S. lilium, which seems to be linked to food–plant distribution.
5. We conclude that individual specialization may affect the way a frugivore moves in space, with direct consequences for seed dispersal and landscape connectivity.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,25:00.0,744,Sturnira lilium,Radio Transmitter

Specifically, the program has been longitudinally monitoring the ecology, behavior, health and reproduction of maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) living in low versus high human activity areas. We also have been evaluating the impact of domestic animals, especially dogs on the health of the carnivore community, in particular maned wolves. The research has been conducted with the different approaches, however data from radiotelemetry has been the starting point for all the crossed analysis. 
Since 2004, 73 animals have been collared. Until 2009 the option of using conventional telemetry restrained us to certain information collected. Since 2007 we have been using GPS-based telemetry in order to obtain more specific information. The data collected from the 13 GPS-collared animals in the last 8 years have been essential for management practices in the project’s site and has been influenced public policies and even the species status in the Brazilian Red List.

The proposed study aims to investigate how landscape structure and habitat quality affect spatial distribution and movements of white-lipped peccaries in tropical heterogeneous landscapes of Brazil, using distinct spatial scales of analysis. Species distribution modeling will be used to access environmental suitability for white-lipped peccary in regional scales of three different Brazilian biomes. Furthermore, individual based modeling and step selection functions will be used to investigate how landscape variables influence movement patterns and habitat selection for this species in landscape and patch scales in areas of the Pantanal and Cerrado.

Please contact the data owner at wgetz@berkeley.edu for the full dataset. The relationship between resource availability and wildlife movement patterns is pivotal to understanding species behavior and ecology. Movement response to landscape variables occurs at multiple temporal scales, from sub-diurnal to multiannual. Additionally, individuals may respond to both current and past conditions of resource availability. In this paper, we examine the temporal scale and variation of current and past resource variables that affect movement patterns of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) using sub-hourly movement data from GPS-GSM collared elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia. We created detailed satellite-based spatiotemporal maps of vegetation biomass, as well as distance from surface water, road and fence. We used step selection functions to measure the relative importance of these landscape variables in determining elephants’ local movement patterns. We also examined how elephants respond to information, in locations they have previously visited, on productivity integrated over different temporal scales: from current to historical conditions. Our results demonstrate that elephants choose patches with higher-than average annual productivity and grass biomass, but lower tree biomass. Elephants also prefer to walk close to water, roads, and fences. These preferences vary with time of day and with season, thereby providing insights into diurnal and seasonal behavioral patterns and the ecological importance of the landscape variables examined. We also discovered that elephants respond more strongly to long-term patterns of productivity than to immediate forage conditions, in familiar locations. Our results illustrate how animals with high cognitive capacity and spatial memory integrate long-term information on landscape conditions. We illuminate the importance of long-term high temporal resolution satellite imagery to understanding the relationship between movement patterns and landscape structure.",research,NA,FALSE,15:00.0,40:00.0,99988,Loxodonta africana,GPS

Here we report the results of a pilot satellite tracking study aimed at establishing the scale of movement of the straw-coloured fruit bat Eidolon helvum. This was the first ever attempt to track African fruit bats using satellite telemetry. We tagged four bats with solar-charged 12 g satellite transmitters at Kasanka National Park in December 2005 and obtained a combined total of 104 different location fixes over a 149-day period. Before migrating, bats foraged as far as 59 km from the roost in a single evening; by contrast, one migrating individual moved 370 km in one night. Bats travelled an average 29 km day−1 over the period of study, with bats that appeared to be migrating moving north-west from Kasanka at an average 90 km day−1. The greatest cumulative distance travelled by a single bat was 2518 km in 149 days. The results show conclusively that the straw-coloured fruit bat E. helvum is capable of migrating thousands of kilometres across central Africa on an annual basis, implying that the fruit pulse in northern Zambia is richer than anything on offer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the same time of the year.",research,NA,FALSE,42:20.0,05:40.0,102,Eidolon helvum,Argos Doppler Shift

The possibility of trans-Andes migration for Amazonian breeding birds has largely been discounted given the high geographic barrier posed by the Andean Cordillera and the desert habitat along much of the Pacific Coast. Here we demonstrate a trans-Andes route for Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger cinerascens) breeding on the Manu River (in the lowlands of Manu National Park, Perú), as well as divergent movement patterns both regionally and across the continent. Of eight skimmers tracked with satellite telemetry, three provided data on their outbound migrations, with two crossing the high Peruvian Andes to the Pacific. A third traveled over 1800 km to the southeast before transmissions ended in eastern Paraguay. One of the two trans-Andean migrants demonstrated a full round-trip migration back to its tagging location after traveling down the Pacific Coast from latitude 9° South to latitude 37° S, spending the austral summer in the Gulf of Arauco, Chile. This is the first documentation of a trans-Andes migration observed for any bird breeding in lowland Amazonia.

Major movements (>5 km per time period) were almost exclusively at night and were undertaken with and without moonlight. Foraging areas used at stopovers in the Llanos de Moxos were remarkably limited, suggesting the importance of grazing lawns maintained by the geese and other herbivores, possibly including cattle. Orinoco Geese are resident in the Llanos de Moxos year-round, so the Manú geese represent a partial migration from the Bení region.

This species was discovered in the wild just 34 years ago at Raso da Catarina, within the Caatinga biome of NE Brazil. Its distribution is restricted to five localities, separated by 34-50 km, where birds nest and roost communally in large cliffs and fragmented forests of rural areas. After the protection of two of these sites, thus reducing nest poaching and illegal trade, the population has grown in recent decades to reach 1,125 individuals in 2010. This moved to download the species from Critically Endangered to Endangered in the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2012). However, a recent assessment revealed that more than ca. 80% of the population is composed by non-breeding birds, as it is expected in a long-lived species with deferred maturity, suggesting it should listed again as Critically Endangered following IUCN criteria (Pacífico et al. 2014). A large research effort has been devoted in recent years to reveal the breeding biology of the species (Pacífico 2011, Pacífico et al. 2013), by accessing to the nests sited in cliffs. However, very few are known on most aspects of the species’ population ecology that are keys to design effective conservation actions. These macaws mostly feed on the fruit of the licuri palm (Syagrus coronata), but also on the fruits of other native Caatinga plants and on corn crops. Corn predation by macaws has caused their persecution by local farmers, to the point that a compensatory program is conducted to alleviate the farmer-macaw conflict (IUCN 2012). The patchy distribution and scarcity of licuri palms due to human and goat overexploitation might force macaws to move large distances to gain access to food, thus switching to consume nearby corn crops. However, the foraging habitat selection and related movements performed to satisfy daily energy requirements are virtually unknown in this species. These requirements, as well as food availability, could change seasonally and depending on the status of individuals. In this sense, the large population fraction composed by non-breeding birds may differ in both energy requirements and movement patterns from breeding birds. Apart from leaving reproductive energetic constraints, non-breeding birds are not attached to nesting sites and thus could made nomadic movements looking for distant but more abundant food resources. Remote tracking arises as a necessary tool to answer the above questions, related to habitat and space requirements, food shortage, agriculture conflict and seasonal movements. Moreover, it would help to delineate the actual area of occupancy of the species, identifying the most important foraging grounds now lacking protection, and even areas (or even populations) so far unknown for the species. We must consider the Caatinga covers ca. 1 million of km2 (Leal et al. 2005), most of them being rather inaccessible or poorly prospected. In fact, recent surveys confirmed a couple of Lear’s macaws distant 250 km from the two known breeding sites, that represents a functionally extinct population, and thus there is the hope that tagged birds could reveal new populations or at least important areas for the species.",research,NA,FALSE,10:53.0,00:34.0,129716,Anodorhynchus leari,"GPS,Radio Transmitter,Acceleration"

In some places the two closely related species occur in the same habitat, feed on the similar prey, and breed during the same time, often in close proximity to one another. But they show extreme differences in their mating system.

The white-browed coucal is socially monogamous, which means that one female and one male form a pair and share parental duties. In the black coucal sex-roles are reversed: Females are almost twice as large as males. Each female sings and defends a large territory, in which she pairs with up to 5 males simultaneously (polyandry). In contrast, the males rarely sing, but incubate the eggs and feed the young without any help from the female.

This study reports the near-real time monitoring of fine-scale behaviour of sunfish. The study was conducted in southern Portugal in May 2014 and involved satellite tags and underwater and surface robotic vehicles to measure both the movements and the contextual environment of the fish. A total of four individuals were tracked using custom-made GPS satellite tags providing geolocation estimates of fine-scale resolution. These accurate positions further informed sunfish areas of restricted search (ARS), which were directly correlated to steep thermal frontal zones. Simultaneously, and for two different occasions, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) video-recorded the path of the tracked fish and detected buoyant particles in the water column. Importantly, the densities of these particles were also directly correlated to steep thermal gradients. Thus, both sunfish foraging behaviour (ARS) and possibly prey densities, were found to be influenced
by analogous environmental conditions. In addition, the dynamic structure of the water transited by
the tracked individuals was described by a Lagrangian modelling approach. The model informed the
distribution of zooplankton in the region, both horizontally and in the water column, and the resultant
simulated densities positively correlated with sunfish ARS behaviour estimator (r s = 0.184, p=0.001).
The model also revealed that tracked fish opportunistically displace with respect to subsurface current
flow. Thus, we show how physical forcing and current structure provide a rationale for a predator’s
fine-scale behaviour observed over a two weeks in May 2014.",research,NA,TRUE,30:00.0,32:00.0,1140,Mola mola,GPS

Tracking data is particularly powerful when combined with oceanographic information derived from satellite remote sensing, allowing insights into the functional mechanisms of marine ecosystems. While this framework has been used extensively over the last two decades, there are still vast ocean regions and many seabird species for which information is scarce, particularly in tropical oceans. 
Methods: In this study we tracked the movement at high GPS recording frequency of 15 White-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus) during chick-rearing from a colony in Fernando de Noronha (offshore of Northeast Brazil). Flight behaviours of travelling and searching for food were derived from GPS data and examined in relation to satellite-sensed oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature, turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration). 
Results: White-tailed Tropicbirds showed marked preference for clear and warm sea surface waters, which are indicative of low primary productivity but are likely the best habitat for preying upon flying fish. 
Discussion: These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that foraging habitat choices of tropical seabirds may not be driven by primary productivity, as has been widely shown for non-tropical species.",research,NA,FALSE,13:55.0,52:02.0,6671,Phaethon lepturus,GPS

Various methods have been developed for classifying animal movement at both coarse (e.g., migratory vs. sedentary behavior) and fine (e.g., resting vs. foraging) scales. A popular approach for classifying movements at coarse resolutions involves fitting time series of net-squared displacement (NSD) to models representing different conceptualizations of coarse movement strategies (i.e., migration, nomadism, sedentarism, etc.). However, the performance of this method in classifying actual (as opposed to simulated) animal movements has been mixed. Here, we develop a more flexible method that uses the same NSD input, but relies on an underlying discrete latent state model. Using simulated data, we first assess how well patterns in the number of transitions between modes of movement and the duration of time spent in a mode classify movement strategies. We then apply our approach to elucidate variability in the movement strategies of eight giant tortoises (Chelonoidis sp.) using a multi-year (2009–2014) GPS dataset from three different Galapagos Islands. Results: With respect to patterns of time spent and the number of transitions between modes, our approach out- performed previous efforts to distinguish among migration, dispersal, and sedentary behavior. We documented marked inter-individual variation in giant tortoise movement strategies, with behaviors indicating migration, dispersal, nomadism and sedentarism, as well as hybrid behaviors such as “exploratory residence”. Conclusions: Distilling complex animal movement into discrete modes remains a fundamental challenge in movement ecology, a problem made more complex by the ever-longer duration, ever-finer resolution, and gap-ridden trajectories recorded by GPS devices. By clustering into modes, we derived information on the time spent within one mode and the number of transitions between modes which enabled finer differentiation of movement strategies over previous methods. Ultimately, the techniques developed here address limitations of previous approaches and provide greater insights with respect to characterization of movement strategies across scales by more fully utilizing long-term GPS telemetry datasets.",research,NA,FALSE,00:50.0,45:09.0,1169859,Testudinidae,GPS

In this experiment we subjected adult lesser black-backed gulls migrating from their Finnish/Russian breeding grounds (from >60°N) to Africa (to < 5°N) to sensory manipulation, to determine the sensory systems required for navigation. We translocated birds westward (1080 km) or eastward (885 km) to simulate natural navigational challenges. When translocated westwards and outside their migratory corridor birds with olfactory nerve section kept a clear directional preference (southerly) but were unable to compensate for the displacement, while intact birds and gulls with the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve sectioned oriented towards their population-specific migratory corridor. Thus, air-borne olfactory information seems to be important for migrating gulls to navigate successfully in some circumstances.

Background. The Grevy’s zebra, a grazing ungulate, is endangered and occurs mostly throughout northern Kenya. Major threats include habitat loss, patchy resource distribution and urban area expansion with increasing livestock densities. Given a poor picture of how Grevy’s zebra utilize space on a landscape scale, this study sought to understand their movements based on how key drivers interact with one another to influence their migration and foraging patterns. 
Method. The three movement drivers identified were vegetation and forage resources, human settlements and water availability. Thirty females were monitored using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars between November 2010 and January 2015. The dynamic Brownian Bridge movement model (dBBMM) was applied to analyze space use in separate “wet” and “dry” periods according to rainfall data. A generalized additive model was applied using presence/absence based on Core Foraging areas (CA’s) determined from the dBBMM analysis to test drivers of movement and their interactions. We expected the CAs to be closer to water sources and further from human settlements than expected at random. 
Results. Results indicated that majority of CAs (80%) occur within community managed conservancies. The most significant effects on movement were distance to water and settlements. Grevy’s zebra CAs were a maximum of 15 km from water, and a minimum of 5-8 km from human settlements is predictable, depending on whether it was a rainy or dry season. Results corroborate findings from previous studies that wildlife competition is occurring, especially in areas with high livestock density and inaccessible water sources. 
Conclusion. We provide recommendations for species recovery and resource conservation to ensure the maintenance of core habitat areas, including key linkages traversing areas important to pastoralists and livestock corridors. Our study is the first description of the species connectivity over the central habitat remaining in the core rangelands of Grevy’s zebra.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,00:00.0,24666,Equidae,"GPS,Radio Transmitter"

More recently molecular testing implicated this species and other African bats as potential reservoir hosts for Ebola virus and it was one of only two fruit bat species epidemiologically linked to the 2008 Luebo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ebola outbreak. Here we share findings from the first pilot study of hammer-headed bat movement using GPS tracking and accelerometry units and a small preceding radio-tracking trial at an apparent lekking site. The radio-tracking revealed adult males had high rates of nightly visitation to the site compared to females (only one visit) and that two of six females day-roosted ~100 m west of Libonga, the nearest village that is ~1.6 km southwest. Four months later, in mid-April 2018, five individual bats, comprised of four males and one female, were tracked from two to 306 days, collecting from 67 to 1022 GPS locations. As measured by mean distance to the site and proportion of nightly GPS locations within 1 km of the site (percent visitation), the males were much more closely associated with the site (mean distance 1.4 km; 51% visitation), than the female (mean 5.5 km; 2.2% visitation). Despite the small sample size, our tracking evidence supports our original characterization of the site as a lek, and the lek itself is much more central to male than female movement. Moreover, our pilot demonstrates the technical feasibility of executing future studies on hammer-headed bats that will help fill problematic knowledge gaps about zoonotic spillover risks and the conservation needs of fruit bats across the continent.",research,NA,FALSE,00:41.0,00:47.0,9428,Hypsignathus monstrosus,"GPS,Acceleration"

Even for the best-studied dispersal system of the Neotropics, Virola nobilis, the dispersal kernel remains unknown. We combined high-resolution GPS/3D-acceleration bird tracking, seed retention experiments, and field observations to quantify dispersal of V. nobilis by their principal dispersers, Ramphastos toucans. We inferred feeding events from movement data, and then estimated spatio-temporally explicit seed-dispersal kernels. Toucans moved an average of 1.8 km d-1 with two distinct activity peaks. Seed retention time averaged 25.5 min (range 4-98 min). Estimated seed dispersal distance averaged 144±147m, with a 56% likelihood of dispersal >100m; this is 2X further than the behaviour-naive estimate from the same data. Dispersal was furthest for seeds ingested in the morning (morning mean 152±154m, midday mean 95±83m), and increased with seed retention time, but only up to 60 min after feeding. Our study supports the long-standing hypothesis that toucans are excellent dispersers of Virola seeds. To maximize seed dispersal distances trees should ripen fruit in the morning when birds move the most, and produce fruits with gut-processing times around 60 min. We also demonstrate how new tracking technology can yield nuanced seed dispersal kernels for animals that cannot be directly observed.",research,NA,TRUE,31:32.0,15:24.0,2480,"Pteroglossus torquatus,Ramphastos sulfuratus,Ramphastos swainsonii","GPS,Acceleration"

Radio tracked individuals flew an average of 218 ± 227 m from their day roosts to 12.0 ± 10.17 ha foraging areas (50% utilization distribution [UD] kernels = area where bats spent 50% of their time as estimated from a probability distribution).

Such an adaptation should allow animals to reduce the cost of having a larger home range in areas with relatively low food availability. We studied how space and refuge use varied with local food availability in the Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), a refuge-inhabiting rodent. We tested whether agoutis living in areas of relatively low food availability had larger home ranges, and whether this response was accompanied by an increase in the number of refuges used. We monitored agoutis in areas with contrasting densities of their principal food source the black palm (Astrocaryum standleyanum). We used both automated and manual radio telemetry to measure space use during the day and refuge use at night. Agoutis living in areas of low food availability had larger home ranges. All individuals used multiple refuges and the number of refuges was not correlated with home range size. Consequently, agoutis that had larger home ranges were forced to roam farther from their nearest refuge to find food. Our results do not support the hypothesis that prey animals use more refuges as they forage across a larger area. Agoutis with large home ranges and low-quality habitat should therefore face an elevated predation risk because they have to spend more time traveling, more time foraging, and are farther away from refuges on average. We hypothesize that agoutis, regardless of their home range size, use multiple refuges to reduce predictability to predators or reduce parasite loads.

It supposedly never sees daylight, roosting in huge aggregations in caves during the day and bringing back fruit to the cave at night. As a consequence a large number of the seeds from the fruit they feed upon germinate in the cave and spoil. Here we use newly developed GPS/acceleration loggers with remote UHF readout to show that several assumptions about the behaviour of Steatornis caripensis need to be revised. On average, they spend only every 3(rd) day in a cave, individuals spent most days sitting quietly in trees in the rainforest where they regurgitate seeds. This provides new data on the extent of seed dispersal and the movement ecology of Steatornis caripensis. It suggests that Steatornis caripensis is perhaps the most important long-distance seed disperser in Neotropical forests. We also show that colony-living comes with high activity costs to individuals.",research,NA,FALSE,30:27.0,00:44.0,3551,Steatornis caripensis,"GPS,Acceleration"

This study was conducted in Thailand between 2007 and 2013 to determine the flyways of Asian Openbills and their role in the spread of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus to poultry and resident birds, and also within their flocks.  Flyways of 5 Openbills from 3 colonies were monitored using Argos satellite transmitters with positioning by Google Earth Programme version 7.1.5. The Openbills and domestic birds living in the vicinity were trapped during the breeding season each year to test for H5N1 HPAI virus infection. During the monitoring period, none of the Openbills tagged with satellite telemeters moved outside of Thailand. The movement of these Openbills did not correlate with H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in domestic poultry, but was correlated with rice crop rotation and populations of the apple snails which are their preferred food. Viral spread within the flocks of Openbills was not observed. This study showed that Openbills played no role in the spread of H5N1 HPAI virus, which was probably due to the very low prevalence of virus during the monitoring period.

But the Mesoamerican subspecies A. m. cyanoptera is highly threatened by poaching and habitat loss, largely driven by intentional forest fires, cattle ranching, and the expansion of human settlements. 

For more than two decades, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has been leading efforts to save MBR’s scarlet macaw population from extirpation through nest protection programs, monitoring macaw fledging rates at key nesting sites, raising awareness through environmental education involving local communities, and habitat protection initiatives including over flights. As a result, our scarlet macaw conservation strategy is based on a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the entire range of threats and interventions required to conserve the species in Guatemala. 

Currently, we are working to accelerate the pace of recovery of the wild scarlet macaw population through a combination of complementary interventions, including management activities designed to maximize the potential contribution of the natural production of wild scarlet macaws. These include pulling of low weight chicks from their nests to be raised at a field laboratory, placement of laboratory-raised chicks back within foster wild nests when viable, or release of laboratory-raised macaws back into the wild following their preparation within an in – situ flight cage. In addition, we are increasing the availability of nesting cavities by enlarging natural cavities to create potential nests, and preventing and combating Africanized bees’ infestation of nesting cavities. These bees are fervent competitors for nesting cavities and can kill young macaw chicks. Additionally, we have engaged local communities and partners in macaw conservation activities, such as AFISAP community forest concession that harbors important macaws nesting habitat.

The White-crowned Pigeon (WCPi) Patagioenas leucocephala is a Caribbean endemic species, classified as “Near-threatened” (IUCN red list), for which data on the ecology and demography are very sparse, fragmentary and unequal across its distribution area. In particular, very few data are available for the Lesser Antilles despite the fact that the species is much appreciated by local hunters and exposed to habitat loss and fragmentation. As for most colombid species, the species have conserved a strong flight ability and is considered as vagrant, sometimes flying more than 150 km over water to reach another Caribbean island. However, a first study aiming at determining movement pattern of 16 white-crowned pigeons in the Greater Antilles (Florida, Bahamas, Cayman Islands Jamaica and Dominican Republic), using Argos Solar transmitters, have shown that the species was less nomadic than expected. These results seem inconsistent with what it was usually thought and with observations done in the Lesser Antilles, where the species is observable only a part of the year. Therefore, “where do pigeons come from when they arrive in the Lesser-Antilles?” and “where do they go when they leave them?” are the questions we are going to answer by using GPS/Argos transmitters. To this end, white-crowned pigeons from Dominican Republic will be captured and equipped with Solar GPS-Argos tags (PinPoint Argos Solar – S, 6g, Biotrack Inc.), following by pigeons from Antigua and Guadeloupe to reach in total fifteen tracked individuals.  We expect that white-crowned pigeons annually observed in the Lesser Antilles are more nomadic, and they come from bigger colonies located in the Greater Antilles (e.g. Puerto-Rico, Hispaniola or Cuba). This would emphasize a dichotomy in term of strategy of dispersal behaviour, which could depend upon genetic (heritability), behavioural (e.g. personality) and/or ecological (e.g. variation of the carrying capacity of islands) factors, resulting in a certain spatial dynamism at the Caribbean region scale.

Utilization distributions have become one of the most common ways to quantify space use and have advanced our knowledge of animal ecology in a variety of ways. However, until recently, they were limited to two dimensions (2D), despite the fact that a majority of taxa use their environments in all three spatial dimensions (3D). In this study we: 1) demonstrate the creation of 3D utilization distributions via a multivariate kernel density estimator, 2) adapt two joint space use indices for use with 3D data, and 3) assess these methods using data from American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) during their non-breeding season in Jamaica. We found that, compared to 3D methods, 2D methods overestimated individual (pairwise) spatial overlap by 3% in scrub habitat and 4% in mangrove habitat. Similarly, 2D methods overestimated total (all neighbors combined) spatial overlap by 9% in scrub and 12% in mangrove habitat. Using joint space use indices, we also found that American Redstarts avoided areas of overlap to some degree, possibly to limit agonistic interactions with neighbors. Although 3D methods require larger sample sizes (80-110 locations) than 2D (40-70 locations), we argue that modeling animal space use in 3D is more realistic and will enhance understanding of niche differentiation, inter- and intra-specific competition, habitat selection and use, and wildlife conservation.",research,NA,FALSE,0011-03-01 05:00:00.000,0012-03-01 05:00:00.000,3614,Setophaga ruticilla,GPS

Although the most informative way of investigating and interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection of high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are scarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution lightweight GPS devices and analysed using a variety of correlation functions inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds’ directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye—both results revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest that hierarchical organization of group flight may be more efficient than an egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise interactions among group members, during which leader–follower relationships are consistently manifested.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we explore whether and how individual association with urban environments is predictive of consistent changes in behavioural season timing and length. Other urbanized species exhibit altered annual cycles such as loss of migratory behavior and year-round breeding in response to consistent resource abundance, often related to intentional and unintentional provisioning. We used behavioral change point analysis to segment the tracks of 41 ibis equipped with GPS backpacks to identify differences in the initiation and duration of four behavioral seasons (non-breeding, pre-breeding, breeding, post-breeding) related to use of urban habitats. We found that intraspecific variation in urban habitat use had strong carryover effects on the timing and duration of behavioral seasons. In particular, ibis with higher urban habitat use in non-breeding seasons had longer non-breeding seasons and shorter breeding seasons that started earlier in the year compared to ibis that primarily use wetland habitats. This study reveals interesting behavioral patterns for a nomadic species with populations that are recently expanding into urban areas, providing evidence that ibis are adapting their annual cycles and seasonal behaviors to exploit urban resources.",research,NA,FALSE,00:47.0,00:00.0,137511,Eudocimus albus,GPS

Mate,"Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) have a global distribution, but the population inhabiting the Gulf of California (GoC) is thought to be geographically and genetically isolated. However, their distribution and movements are poorly known. The goal of this study was to describe fin whale movements for the first time from 11 Argos satellite tags deployed in the southwest GoC in March 2001. A Bayesian Switching State-Space Model was applied to obtain improved locations and to characterize movement behavior as either “area-restricted searching” (indicative of patch residence, ARS) or “transiting” (indicative of moving between patches). Model performance was assessed with convergence diagnostics and by examining the distribution of the deviance and the behavioral parameters from Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. ARS was the predominant mode behavior 83% of the time during both the cool (December-May) and warm seasons (June-November), with slower travel speeds (mean= 0.84 km/h) than during transiting mode (mean= 3.38 km/h). We suggest ARS mode indicates either foraging activities (year around) or reproductive activities during the winter (cool season). We tagged during the cool season, when the whales were located in the Loreto-La Paz Corridor in the southwestern GoC, close to the shoreline. As the season progressed, individuals moved northward to the Midriff Islands and the upper gulf for the warm season, much farther from shore. One tag lasted long enough to document a whale’s return to Loreto the following cool season. One whale that was originally of undetermined sex, was tagged in the Bay of La Paz and was photographed 10 years later with a calf in the nearby San Jose Channel, suggesting seasonal site fidelity. The tagged whales moved along the western GoC to the upper gulf seasonally and did not transit to the eastern GoC south of the Midriff Islands. No tagged whales left the GoC, providing supporting evidence that these fin whales are a resident population.",research,NA,FALSE,48:24.0,55:33.0,572,Balaenoptera physalus,Argos Doppler Shift

Little is known about the natural history and ecology of the striped mud turtle (Kinosternon baurii), although previous work in Florida suggest that these aquatic turtles are highly terrestrial and nest primarily in the fall. We are currently conducting a population and spatial ecology project on the striped mud turtle using radio telemetry at Circle B Bar Reserve, a restored former cattle ranch adjacent to Lake Hancock, Polk County, Florida. To date, we are tracking six striped mud turtles, and we are collecting standard natural history data on morphology and reproduction. In addition, we have implemented a continuous mark and recapture study for this population. Our data indicate that these mud turtles have a fairly small home range (no single movement more than 75m) with males generally moving more often and greater distances than females. The health of captured turtles is generally good, although feral pigs and human interactions (especially after national news events) appear to represent the greatest threats to the turtles. The population at Circle B does not appear to be dense, as we recapture many of the same turtles. However, after almost 2 years of sampling, we are still capturing unmarked turtles and the population is represented by multiple size classes from small juveniles to large females. Overall, the data we have collected is helping Circle B Bar Reserve understand more about their striped mud turtle population and expands their knowledge of the wildlife they protect. With specific knowledge on the population size and habitat use, Circle B and other reserves/parks in central Florida can better accommodate small, often overlooked aquatic turtles into their management plans.

Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude were less than the typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model output. Therefore, broad-scale interpretation of Argos tracking data will likely be unaffected, although fine-scale interpretation should be made with more caution for deep-diving species inhabiting warm regions.",research,NA,FALSE,16:00.0,22:23.0,7151,Physeter macrocephalus,GPS

These medium-sized vultures (weighing around 2,500 g) are heavily dependent on resources provided by goat farming (both intensive and extensive) and carcasses of small and medium-sized wild mammals and birds.  The population has been monitored since 1998 so that 90% of the birds are now individualized by means of plastic rings. The Canarian Egyptian vulture population is increasing about 5% per year but still supports relatively high rates of unnatural deaths, mainly caused by accidents on power lines, although the impact of toxic compounds as lead from ammunition and veterinary drugs plays also a relevant role. This study uses GPS/GSM radio transmitters to determine the use of space both by territorial individuals and birds in the pre-adult stage. The specific objectives focus on two non-independent lines: the study of the ecology movement in relation to the availability of resources and the identification of factors determining dispersive processes and territory recruitment.

Mate,"Here, we describe the diving behavior of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) using the Advanced Dive Behavior (ADB) tag, which records depth data at 1‐Hz resolution and GPS‐quality locations for over 1 month, before releasing from the whale for recovery. A total of 27 ADB tags were deployed on sperm whales in the central Gulf of California, Mexico, during spring 2007 and 2008, of which 10 were recovered for data download. Tracking durations of all tags ranged from 0 to 34.5 days (median = 2.3 days), and 0.6 to 26.6 days (median = 5.0 days) for recovered tags. Recovered tags recorded a median of 50.8 GPS‐quality locations and 42.6 dives per day. Dive summary metrics were generated for archived dives and were subsequently classified into six categories using hierarchical cluster analysis. A mean of 77% of archived dives per individual were one of four dive categories with median Maximum Dive Depth >290 m (V‐shaped, Mid‐water, Benthic, or Variable), likely associated with foraging. Median Maximum Dive Depth was <30 m for the other two categories (Short‐ and Long‐duration shallow dives), likely representing socializing or resting behavior. Most tagged whales remained near the tagging area during the tracking period, but one moved north of Isla Tiburón, where it appeared to regularly dive to, and travel along the seafloor. Three whales were tagged on the same day in 2007 and subsequently traveled in close proximity (<1 km) for 2 days. During this period, the depth and timing of their dives were not coordinated, suggesting they were foraging on a vertically heterogeneous prey field. The multiweek dive records produced by ADB tags enabled us to generate a robust characterization of the diving behavior, activity budget, and individual variation for an important predator of the mesopelagos over temporal and spatial scales not previously possible.",research,NA,FALSE,36:26.0,10:00.0,4506,Physeter macrocephalus,"GPS,Accessory Measurements"

Of the two extant groups of vertebrates that are capable of powered flight, birds are thought to fly more efficiently and faster than bats. However, fast-flying bat species that are adapted for flight in open airspace are similar in wing shape and appear to be similar in flight dynamics to fast-flying birds that exploit the same aerial niche. Here, we investigate flight behaviour in seven free-flying Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) and report that the maximum ground speeds achieved exceed speeds previously documented for any bat. Regional wind modelling indicates that bats adjusted flight speeds in response to winds by flying more slowly as wind support increased and flying faster when confronted with crosswinds, as demonstrated for insects, birds and other bats. Increased frequency of pauses in wing beats at faster speeds suggests that flap-gliding assists the bats’ rapid flight. Our results suggest that flight performance in bats has been underappreciated and that functional differences in the flight abilities of birds and bats require re-evaluation.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,07:54.0,561,Tadarida brasiliensis,Radio Transmitter

Fifty-two vultures were trapped at the Freeman Ranch in San Marcos, TX using a walk in trap. Trapping occurred between April  1 – April 10, 2013. All 52 vultures received pink patagial wing tags in the patagium of the right wing.  From the group of 52 trapped vultures, six received 70g solar Argos PTT-100 GPS transmitters (four Black Vultures and two Turkey Vultures). All tagged vultures, including the six with transmitters, were released from the tagging site during  the afternoon and evening of April 10, 2013. The deployment-on time is 2:00 AM (CST) on April 11, 2013 to allow for consistency in the data analysis. 
Prior to transmitter deployment, the transmitters were pre-programmed to record 19 Geographical Positioning System (GPS) location fixes per day. The fix times selected were based on the hours of sunrise and sunset in deployment-on location (Freeman Ranch in San Marcos, TX). Sunrise and sunset times for the entire year were considered and the chosen fix times allowed for hourly GPS fixes during the day and then periodic GPS fixes during the night. The need to include gaps in the nighttime fix rate was to conserve transmitter battery power, which operates using solar energy.

Large fat reserves and low humidity, indicative of beneficial synoptic weather patterns, favored southward departure across the Gulf. Individuals detected in the YP departed with large fat reserves and later in the fall with profitable winds, and flight durations (mean = 22.4 h) were positively related to wind profit.

Adults, males and higher quality individuals typically arrive earlier, and across years, early arrival has been linked to warmer spring temperatures. However, the mechanisms and potential costs of early arrival are not well understood. 
(2) To deepen the understanding of arrival date differences between individuals and years, we studied them in light of the preceding spring migration behaviour and atmospheric conditions en route. 
(3) GPS and body‐acceleration (ACC) data were obtained for 35 adult white storks (Ciconia ciconia) over five years (2012‐2016). ACC records were translated to energy expenditure estimates (Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration; ODBA) and to behavioural modes, and GPS fixes were coupled with environmental parameters. 
(4) At the inter‐individual level (within years), early arrival was attributed primarily to departing earlier for migration and from more northern wintering sites (closer to breeding grounds), rather than to migration speed. In fact, early departing birds flew slower, experienced weaker thermal uplifts and expended more energy during flight, but still arrived earlier, emphasizing the cost and the significance of early departure. Individuals that wintered further south arrived later at the breeding grounds but did not produce fewer fledglings, presumably due to positive carry‐over effects of advantageous wintering conditions (increased precipitation, vegetation productivity and daylight time). Therefore, early arrival increased breeding success only after controlling for wintering latitude. Males arrived slightly ahead of females. Between years, late arrival was linked to colder temperatures en route through two different mechanisms: stronger headwinds causing slower migration and lower thermal uplifts resulting in longer stopovers. 
(5) This study showed that distinct migratory properties underlie arrival time variation within and between years. It highlighted: (a) an overlooked cost of early arrival induced by unfavourable atmospheric conditions during migration, (b) an important fitness trade‐off in storks between arrival date and wintering habitat quality, and (c) mechanistic explanations for the negative temperature‐arrival date correlation in soaring birds. Such understanding of arrival time can facilitate forecasting migrating species responses to climate changes.",research,NA,FALSE,00:44.0,00:10.0,1207130,Ciconia ciconia,"GPS,Acceleration,Accessory Measurements"

Without such information, it is impossible to understand full annual cycle ecology and effectively implement conservation actions that address where and when populations are most limited. We deployed and recovered light-level geolocators (n = 34) at six breeding sites in North America across the breeding range of a declining long-distance migratory bird, the Prothonotary Warbler (
<i>Protonotaria citrea</i>). We sought to determine migratory routes, stopover location and duration, and the location of overwintering grounds. We found that the species exhibits a large-scale, east-west split in migratory routes and weak migratory connectivity across their range. Specifically, almost all individuals, regardless of breeding origin, overlapped in their estimated wintering location in northern Colombia, in an area 20% the size of the breeding range. Additionally, the majority of individuals across all breeding locations concentrated in well-defined stopover locations in Central America while en route to Colombia. While error inherent in light-level geolocation cannot be fully ruled out, surprisingly, much of the estimated wintering area included inland areas, despite the fact that Prothonotary Warblers are considered a specialist on coastal mangroves in winter. Based on these results, conservation efforts directed at very specific nonbreeding geographical areas will potentially have benefits across most of the breeding population. Our findings highlight the importance of using modern technologies to validate assumptions about little studied portions of species’ annual life cycles, and the need to distribute sampling across species ranges.",research,NA,FALSE,51:24.0,46:12.0,16835,Protonotaria citrea,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw"

The Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis (LFFH) suggests a single optimal food search strategy to explain this pattern, yet mixed movement distributions are biologically more plausible and often convincingly fit movement data. To confront alternative explanations for these patterns, we tracked vultures of three species in two very different ecosystems using high-resolution GPS/accelerometer tags accompanied by behavioral, genetic and morphological data. The Lévy distribution fitted the datasets reasonably well, matching expectations based on their sparsely distributed food resources; yet, the fit of mixed models was considerably better, suggesting distinct movement modes operating at three different scales. Specifically, long-range forays (LRFs)—rare, short-term, large-scale circular journeys that greatly exceed the typical foraging range and contribute to the tail-fatness of the movement distribution in all three species—do not match an optimal foraging strategy suggested by the LFFH. We also found no support for preferred weather conditions or population genetic structure as alternative explanations, so the hypothesis that LRFs represent failed breeding dispersal attempts to find mates remains our most plausible explanation at this time. We conclude that inference about the mechanisms underlying animal movements should be confronted with complementary data, and suggest that mixed behavioral-modes likely explain commonly observed fat-tailed movement distributions.",research,NA,TRUE,00:00.0,10:00.0,152594,"Gyps fulvus,Gyps africanus,Torgos tracheliotus",GPS

Landfills all over the world attract birds, which use them as a food source. When these landfills are located in close proximity to airports, the birds constitute serious hazards to aircrafts and their crew. In Israel, among the most prevalent species visiting landfills is the Black Kite (Milvus migrans). 
The Black Kite is a medium-sized raptor that migrates through Israel during the spring and autumn, and winters in large numbers throughout the country. Its population in Israel has increased from few thousands during the 1990’s years to present numbers of more than 30,000, only in the Northern Negev. The Ganei-Hadas and Dudaim waste Facilities, located 10 kilometers from the Israeli Air Force (IAF) Hatzerim airbase, attract the highest number of Black Kites. Besides these two landfills, the Black Kites also feed in open fields and inside the airbase. 
The landfills’ proximity to the airbase causes constant conflicts, during the over-wintering period, between the Black Kites and the IAF aircrafts. The presence of the kites within Hatzerim airspace leads to direct collisions with aircrafts, impedes important training flights and negatively impacts the base operational competence. Therefore, there is an immediate need to understand movement patterns of these wintering kites.
My research goals are: 
1. Track and monitor movement patterns and behavior of the Black Kites in the Northern Negev; 
2. Examine the influence of food availability, using manipulation experiments at the landfill, on Black Kites movement, habitat selection, spatial distribution and behavior; 
3. Incorporate information on Black Kite movement patterns with remote sensing methods to mitigate Black Kite and aircraft collisions at Hatzerim airbase, as well as other airbases. 
This study is planned to be the first to assess the movement ecology of an abundant over-wintering raptor and the factors influencing it in Israel. The goals will be achieved by monitoring individuals using GPS and acceleration tags, and monitoring Black Kite populations using field surveys, cameras and a Multi-Mission Hemispheric Radar.

By combining information from comprehensive diet and movement analyses we found four dimensions of differentiation: (1) Geographic foraging area: LLB tended to forage relatively close to their nests (2.35 ± 0.62 km), while STE forage far from their nest (13.03 ± 2.20 km); (2) Foraging-habitat type: LLBs forage at low natural vegetation, avoiding cultivated fields, whereas STEs forage in cultivated fields, avoiding low natural vegetation; (3) Diurnal dynamics of foraging: LLBs are uniformly active during daytime, whereas STEs activity peaks in the early afternoon; and (4) Food-niche: while both species largely rely on reptiles (47.8% and 76.3% for LLB and STE, respectively), LLB had a more diverse diet and consumed significantly higher percentages of lizards, while STE consumed significantly higher percentages of snakes.

In South Carolina, the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is managed as a renewable natural resource, through public and private lands harvest programs. To date, South Carolina’s monitoring program for the species has primarily focused on abundance estimation but has not incorporated efforts to identify underlying mechanisms that may drive variation in realized or observed abundance patterns (e.g., habitat selection). Here we propose to conduct a movement ecology study of adult male alligators. We will deploy GPS transmitters in coastal South Carolina, within the Santee Delta and ACE Basin regions. Our objectives are to (1) quantify alligator movement patterns and sources of variation therein (e.g., individual, environmental, spatial); (2) determine if individual movement patterns among habitat types are consistent with patterns observed in nightlight survey counts; and (3) evaluate the use of reserves (e.g., Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center) in relation to harvest exposure. Objective 2 will allow us to derive more accurate population estimates by establishing potential bias in nightlight surveys and objective 3 will inform landscape-scale conservation planning (e.g., reserve design).",research,NA,FALSE,01:00.0,02:30.0,576,Alligator mississippiensis,GPS

One method of removing predators is to relocate “problem raptors” away from the Base, a process also known as translocation. The Base and others have used translocation without fully assessing the efficacy of this method since it has relied on the identification of returning individuals with previously attached, unique, leg colorbands. This study quantified return rates and survival of raptors fitted with satellite transmitters and translocated distances greater than those recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Success was measured by survival of the translocated raptors for at least 60 days following release, and whether they returned to the least tern and plover nesting colonies during the breeding season. Over three breeding seasons we translocated 20 raptors of five different species fitted with transmitters; all birds were moved a minimum of 240 miles and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) were moved at least 500 miles. Most (80%) of the translocated birds survived 60 days or longer following translocation. Northern harriers (Circus cyaneus) were the most frequently documented and translocated “problem raptor,” including one nesting male that was captured and translocated in two different years. Birds returned to MCBCP 12 times; only one, an adult northern harrier, returned prior to 15 Aug. Juvenile red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicencis) generally moved along their expected migration path north to the Great Basin before returning south to the Base. Eleven birds died during the course of the study, including one that was lethally removed for repeatedly depredating least terns at Batiquitos Lagoon, south of the Base. There is some evidence to suggest that birds that had achieved breeding age returned more quickly to the Base and survived longer; the individual that returned the fastest was a bird known to have a nest with eggs at the time of translocation; however our sample size was small and there were no significant differences in return rates or mortality based on species, age, sex, or breeding status. We recommend an approach to “problem raptors” of different species and breeding status based on these initial results. We also recommend that future studies might use satellite or cellular transmitters to compare return rates of raptors translocated the shorter USFWS-recommended distances with the results from this effort. In addition, we also recommend investigating the effect of a short period of captivity after initial capture, to further reduce homing behavior, coupled with translocation",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Argos location errors for blue and fin whale tags were similar and were combined (n = 1,712 locations) for comparison against sperm whale tags (n = 1,206 locations). Location error magnitudes for tags attached to sperm whales were significantly larger than blue/fin whale tags for almost all Argos location classes (LC), ranging from 964 m versus 647 m for LC 3, respectively, to 10,569 m versus 5,589 m for LC B, respectively. However, these differences were not seen while tags floated at the surface after release. Sperm whale tags were significantly colder than ambient temperature when surfacing from a dive, compared to blue/fin whale tags (16.9°C versus 1.3°C, respectively) leading to larger changes in tag temperature during post-dive intervals. The increased rate of tag temperature change while at the surface was correlated to increased error magnitude for sperm whale tags but not blue/fin whale tags. Movement model output was not significantly improved by incorporating species-specific error parameters. Location accuracy estimates for blue/fin whales were within the range estimated for other marine megafauna, but were higher for sperm whales. Thermal inertia from deep, long-duration dives likely caused transmission frequency drift and greater Argos location error in sperm whales, as tags warmed at the surface during post-dive intervals. Thus, tracks of deep-diving species may be less reliable than for other species. However, differences in calculated error magnitude were less than the typical scales of movement and had limited effect on movement model output.

OK to use for educational purposes.,CUSTOM,33.77,-117.71,Turkey Vulture Acopian Center USA GPS,79,78,78,NA,NA,NA,"The Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) is the most widely distributed, as well as the most abundant, of all scavenging birds of prey.  The species, which occurs only in the new World, can be seen as far north as southern Canada and as far south as Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America.  Turkey Vultures also occur on many large and small islands including Vancouver Island, Canada, Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea, and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.  Six races or subspecies of Turkey Vultures are recognized by biologists:  including septentrionalis in eastern North America, meridionalis in western North America, aura in Mexico, parts of the Caribbean and Central America, ruficollis in southern Central and northern and central South America, jota in South America and falklandica in southern South America and the Falkland Islands.  The scientific name for Turkey Vulture, Cathartes aura, translates as “breezy cleanser,” most likely a reflection of its soaring and scavenging life style. 

Scientists consider North American populations of Turkey Vultures to be partial migrants, in that northern populations of the species migrate, whereas southern populations, in general, do not.  Eastern North American populations of the species typically migrate no farther south than Florida and Texas.  Western populations travel at least as far as Colombia and Venezuela, and some experts believe that some western birds may travel as far south as Brazil and Argentina.  Millions of migrating Turkey Vultures have been counted annually at migration watch sites in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama.

As scientists we are interested in learning more about the movement ecology of this extremely successful raptor, which seems to have one of the most flexible of all avian migration systems.  Earlier reports from northern South America suggest that northern migrants, which are larger and more massive than local residents, dominate the latter when they arrive on their wintering grounds in December each year.  The extent to which such dominance affects the breeding schedules and numbers of southern birds remains unknown, as does the extent to which individual migrants visit an over-winter in the same location each year.

In the spring of 2003 Hawk Mountain Sanctuary initiated a long-term study of migration behavior in Turkey Vultures in an effort to learn more about the extent, causes, and consequences of their annual journeys.  To date scientists at the sanctuary and its collaborators have placed tiny radio tags monitored by satellite on 21 Turkey Vultures in an effort to follow their outbound migrations south each autumn and their return migrations north each spring.  Five of the satellite-tracked birds also had a data logger surgically implanted in their body cavities.  The loggers record both core body temperature and heart rate.  Recovering these data loggers allows us to determine fluctuations in both body temperature and heart rate associated with day-night cycles and migration activity.  The Sanctuary and its collaborators also have placed red, yellow, or light blue numbered wing tags on more than one hundred Turkey Vultures in Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.

Thus we examined the spatial activity of copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix) in regard to pedestrian trails within an urban forest. We used radio telemetry to track snakes during the active season, and estimated distances moved in between relocations, distances to the nearest trail, and home range size for individuals. We found sex and season, but not distance to the nearest trail, affected the distance snakes moved. In addition, we observed a weak, positive relationship between home range size and average distance to the trail. Sex, season, and body condition did not explain snake distance to the trail, but individual patterns were variable for snakes compared to random locations generated from snake relocations. Our study indicates copperheads may be tolerant of low-level human disturbances found in an urban forest. Further work should be done to quantify levels of disturbance, such as trail use, and compare the behavior of reptiles across urban park types and locations.",research,NA,FALSE,36:00.0,22:00.0,1630,Agkistrodon contortrix,Radio Transmitter

To identify and interpret commonalities within clusters, we compared them to computer-simulated idealized movement syndromes representing suites of correlated movement traits observed across taxa (migration, nomadism, territoriality, and central place foraging). Two principal components explained 70% of the variance among the movement metrics we evaluated across the thirteen species, and were used for the cluster analysis. The resulting analysis revealed four statistically distinct clusters. All simulated individuals of each idealized movement syndrome organized into separate clusters, suggesting that the four clusters are explained by common movement syndrome.

Mate,"Baleen whale migrations typically consist of annual movements between productive, high-latitude feeding grounds and unproductive, low-latitude breeding grounds. However, the actual migratory path and whales’ behaviour in these locations are poorly known. The objectives of this study were to apply a switching state-space model to the satellite tracks of blue whales Balaenoptera musculus in the Northeast Pacific to improve location estimation and gain insight into the migratory (transiting) and foraging (area-restricted search, ARS) behaviours of this population. During the period 1993 to 2007, Argos satellite tags were attached to 159 whales, mainly off the coast of California during late summer, of which 92 tracks were >7 d in duration. There was generally a southward movement during the winter to Baja California and to an area west of the Costa Rica Dome, in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP). Travel speeds during transit were significantly faster than during ARS movements (mean = 3.70 and 1.05 km h^–1, respectively). On average, 29% of the track time was spent in ARS, and the mean time within an ARS patch was 21 d. The occurrence of ARS behaviour throughout the migration cycle suggests that these animals may forage year-round, but could also indicate limited movements during the reproductive season. The extent of their northward migration from Baja California to Washington varied significantly interannually, likely in response to environmental changes affecting their prey. The long track durations obtained from electronic tagging have provided essential new information about the critical habitats of Northeast Pacific blue whales.",research,NA,FALSE,20:00.0,34:34.0,15778,Balaenoptera musculus,"GPS,Argos Doppler Shift"

Only three cats ranged > 1 km^2 and we found no relationship between home range size and the presence of larger native predators (i.e. coyotes, Canis latrans). Most (75%) cats used primarily (90%) disturbed habitats. Owners reported that their pets killed an average of 3.5 prey items/month, leading to an estimated ecological impact per cat of 14.2‐38.9 prey ha^−1 yr^−1.

These parameters were modelled against wind speed and direction, time of the day, solar irradiance (proxy of thermal uplift), starting altitude and distance to Morocco, and age and sex of birds. We found that sea crossing performance of black kites is driven by their age, the wind conditions, the starting altitude and the starting distance to Morocco. Young birds assumed more risks than adults by making longer sea crossings and reaching lower altitude above the sea. Crosswinds promoted longer sea crossings, with birds reaching lower altitudes and with higher flapping effort. Birds starting at lower altitudes were more likely to quit or made higher flapping effort to complete the sea crossing.

Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines.

The historical range of Geronticus eremita probably extended throughout North Africa and into the Middle East. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the species has been known from two disjunct populations: a western population in Morocco currently estimated at 300 individuals, an eastern migratory population between Syria and Ethiopia (less than 5 individuals) and in Turkey where remain 180 semi-captive birds (“BirdLife International,” 2015).
Between 2004 and 2011 an experimental programme, “Proyecto Eremita”, was accomplished in La Janda (Cádiz, southwestern Spain), to evaluate the efficiency of different releasing techniques of ibises bred in captivity in European zoos (NBI EEP) aimed to establish sedentary populations in this area. The “Proyecto Eremita” was developed by  the regional government of Andalusia (Junta de Andalucía) in collaboration with ZooBotánico Jerez, Estación Biológica de Doñana (EBD-CSIC) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). The success of that project encouraged its promoters to undertake the reintroduction program in Andalusia  since 2012.
 
As a result of the “Proyecto Eremita” and the reintroduction program, La Janda has currently a wild population of roughly 80 individuals where a small breeding colony was settled in Vejer de la Frontera (Cádiz) in 2008, reaching the 25 breeding pairs in 2014. Among the next challenges for the team involved are the assessment of population viability, as well as advance the knowledge of the ecology of this rare bird. To this end, from 2014 a GPS tracking of some adults and juvenile birds is being conducted to improve insights into the species' threats and other ecological requirements (Vázquez et al., 2015).",research,NA,TRUE,03:15.0,00:32.0,8566306,Geronticus eremita,"GPS,Acceleration"

operating area (OPAREA) waters off the Virginia coast are heavily utilized for training and testing by the
U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps. Over the past three years, HDR has worked with the U.S. Navy to
carry out vessel-based line transect visual surveys, photo-identification (photo ID) surveys, and focal
follow surveys with the goal of determining bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) densities and site
fidelity as well as humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) habitat use within waters adjacent to naval
Station Norfolk, Joint Expiditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck
Annex, and within and the MINEX W-50. 

To establish baseline occurrence and behavior data for humpback whales in the Hampton Roads mid-Atlantic region, this study aims to address the following questions:
• What age classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) are utilizing the waters within and adjacent to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay?
• Do humpback whales exhibit site-fidelity over periods of days to years?
• Do humpback whales congregate in specific high-traffic and/or high-use U.S. Navy training areas?
• Do humpback whales spend significant time within or move through areas of U.S. Navy live-fire and MINEX training?

However, relatively little information exists on how numerous offshore species, including beaked whales and endangered fin and sperm whales utilize the waters of the VACAPES OPAREA near the continental shelf break habitat.
Recent aerial surveys by the Virginia Aquarium, University of North Carolina Wilmington, and HDR (HDR,
2010), as well as vessel surveys by HDR, suggest that baleen whales, sperm whales, and other deep
diving odontocetes may be more common to the area of interest than first thought. The objectives of this
study are to utilize a combination of techniques including 1) photo-ID and behavioral data collection to
provide baseline assessments of animal movement patterns, site-fidelity, habitat use, life-history, and
behavior; 2) biopsy sampling to identify individuals, determine foraging patterns, and assist in delineating
stock structure boundaries; 3) satellite-monitored tagging techniques to supplement photo-ID-based
studies by providing information on residency patterns and habitat use across longer time scales (weeks
to months).

Millspaugh,"Examining the ways in which animals use habitat and select resources to satisfy their life history requirements has important implications for ecology, evolution, and conservation. The advent of radio-tracking in the mid-20th century greatly expanded the scope of animal-habitat modeling. Thereafter, it became common practice to aggregate telemetry data collected on a number of tagged individuals and fit one model describing resource selection at the population level. This convention however, runs the risk of masking important individuality in the nature of associations between animals and their environment. Here we investigated the importance of individual variation in animal-habitat relationships via the study of a highly gregarious species. We modeled elk (Cervus elaphus) location data, collected from Global Positioning System (GPS) collars, using Bayesian discrete choice resource selection function (RSF) models. Using a high-performance computing cluster we batch-processed these models at the level of each individual elk (n = 88) and evaluated the output with respect to: i) the composition of parameters in the most supported models, ii) the estimates of the parameters featured in the global models, and iii) spatial maps of the predicted relative probabilities of use. We detected considerable individual variation across all three metrics. For instance, the most supported models varied with respect to parameter composition with a range of seven to 17 and an average of 14.4 parameters per individual elk. The estimates of the parameters featured in the global models also varied greatly across individual elk with little conformity detected across age or sex classes. Finally, spatial mapping illustrated stark differences in the predicted relative probabilities of use across individual elk. Our analysis identifies that animal-habitat relationships, even among the most gregarious of species, can be highly variable. We discuss the implications of our results for ecology and present some guiding principles for the development of RSF models at the individual-animal level.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,00:00.0,33505,Cervus elaphus,GPS

The North American race (N.p. hudsonicus) includes two disjunct breeding populations, both of which winter primarily in Central and South America. The western population breeds in Alaska and the Northwest Territories of Canada. The eastern population breeds south and west of Hudson Bay in Manitoba and Ontario. The prevailing idea was that the western population followed a Pacific Coast migration route between breeding and wintering areas in Panama and western South America, and that the Hudson Bay population followed an Atlantic Coast migration route to wintering grounds in Northeast South America. Both populations are of high conservation concern due to population declines in recent decades. Investigations into the migration routes of whimbrels staging in Virginia have shown a previously unknown link between the eastern and western populations as they stop-over in Virginia. The primary objective of this project is to examine the stop-over and migration strategies of whimbrels, as they relate to the conservation of the species.

We tracked 35 individuals from two colonies using high frequency GPS-dataloggers over four consecutive breeding seasons. Contrary to expectations, kestrels relied heavily on thermal soaring when foraging, especially during periods of high solar radiation. This produced a circadian pattern in the kestrel flight strategy that led to a spatial segregation of foraging areas. Kestrels flapped towards foraging areas close to the colony when thermals were not available. However, as soon as thermals were formed, they soared on them towards foraging areas far from the colony, especially when they were surrounded by poor foraging habitats. This reduced the chick provisioning rate at the colony. Given that lesser kestrels have a preference for feeding on large insects, and considering the average distance they cover to capture them during foraging trips, to commute using flapping flight would result in a negative energy balance for the family group. Our results show that lesser kestrels prioritize saving energy when foraging, suggesting that kestrels are more energy than time-constrained during the breeding season.",research,NA,FALSE,48:34.0,30:34.0,876767,Falco naumanni,GPS

Between September 2014 and August 2016, we captured six adult leopards (5 males and 1 female) and fitted them with GPS-satellite Iridium collars to provide information on basic ecology of the Persian leopard. We calculated MCP 100% home ranges of 62.9 to 1,098.3 km2. The ranges here were generally smaller than the one of the only other Persian leopard collared before this study in an arid mountain area in central Iran, except for the young, possibly dispersing male that we collared.

We used a Bayesian state-space model to estimate the most likely breeding locations. All four birds spent the breeding season on the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. These locations spanned approximately 1200 kilometers, and none of the individuals bred in the same location. Speed of migration was nearly twice as fast during spring than fall. The return rate of birds tagged the previous season (33%) was similar to that of control birds (39%), but comparing return rates was complicated because 7 of 11 returning birds had lost their tags.

This process has led to an increase in both the population size and the extent of its range. Thus again they become a key role in the functioning of ecosystems being also an important socioeconomic resource. Andalusia hosts important populations of native and introduced wild ungulates and game management is a dynamic element of rural economies and a source of food resources for communities of vertebrate scavengers many of which are endangered species. In fact, the binomial ungulates-scavengers provide an important ecosystem service that has hardly been studied. This project aims to address the interactions between conservation biology and game management. With this overall objective is intended to analyze the factors that determine the structure and functioning of food webs associated scavengers to the big game, the movement patterns of resource consumers that have different spatial and temporal predictability, the capacity of the system to maintain viable populations of carrion birds and, finally, to evaluate some of the emerging risks associated with consumption of carcasses of large game such as lead poisoning.

Differences in size and environmental characteristics of ontogenetic habitats can lead to differences in movement patterns, behaviour, habitat use and spatial distributions across individuals of the same species. Knowledge of juvenile loggerhead turtles’ dispersal, movements and habitat use is largely unknown, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. Satellite relay data loggers were used to monitor movements, diving behaviour and water temperature of eleven large juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) deliberately caught in an oceanic habitat in the Mediterranean Sea. Hidden Markov Models were used over 4430 spatial locations to quantify the different activities performed by each individual: transit, low and high intensity diving. Model results were then analysed in relation to water temperature, bathymetry and distance to the coast. The Hidden Markov Model differentiated between bouts of Area Restricted Search as low and high intensity diving, and transit movements. The turtles foraged in deep oceanic waters within 60 km from the coast as well as above 140 km from the coast. They used an average area of 194802 km2, where most individuals used the deepest part of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea with the highest seamounts, while only two switched to neritic foraging showing plasticity in foraging strategies among turtles of similar age classes. The foraging distribution of large juvenile loggerhead turtles, including some which were of the minimum size of adults, in the Tyrrhenian Sea is mainly concentrated in a relatively small oceanic area with predictable mesoscale oceanographic features, despite the proximity of suitable neritic foraging habitats. Our study highlights the importance of collecting high-resolution data about species distribution and behaviour across different spatio-temporal scales and life stages for implementing conservation and Dynamic Ocean Management actions.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,Argos Doppler Shift

We propose to fit 3 Microwave Telemetry 70 gram GSM/GPS transmitters to 50-55 day old chicks (pre-fledging age). The eagles are fitted with a transmitter using a backpack style harness and returned to the nest within1 hour. We have used this method in previous studies and were able to provide data on local movements of eagles for the US Army, US Navy, and USFWS Chesapeake Bay Field Office. The young eagles utilize similar foraging areas as their parents within the natal territory.  After the chicks fledge the nest they typically stay in the natal territory for 1 to 8 months before dispersing (n = 19, Mojica unpub. data).      

Data from the transmitter will be monitored once a week to check on the status of the eagle(s). Data will be stored online in a free but secure cloud service provided by Movebank.org. Navy personnel will be given an account to access the data and set up daily or weekly email alerts.

We differentiated seven classes of land cover—alfalfa, annually rotated irrigated crops, developed, grassland, orchard / vineyard, rice, and water. From 2011–2013, we fitted transmitters with global positioning systems to 23 adult Swainson’s Hawks. We recorded a minimum of six locations per day per bird from spring through early autumn of each year. We used a fixed, bivariate-normal kernel estimator to calculate a utilization distribution at 30-m resolution for each life stage of each individual within each year. We used a linear mixed model to estimate the associations between intensity of space use and land cover, sex, and reproductive status. The majority of adult Swainson’s Hawks traveled distances up to 8–10 km from the nest throughout the breeding season. Median seasonal home-range sizes in a given year ranged from 87–172 km2. The association between intensity of space use and grassland was 50–139% stronger, and the association between intensity of space use and alfalfa 23–59% stronger, than the associations between intensity of space use and any other land-cover type. Intensity of space use did not vary as a function of sex, reproductive status, or life stage. Given our results and additional knowledge of the species’ ecology, we suggest that reproductive success and, in turn, population-level recruitment may be associated equally if not more closely with availability of nesting sites than with the current distribution of land cover.

We attached satellite transmitters (aka “Platform Transmitter Terminals” or “PTTs”) to Pintails on their wintering areas in Japan, and tracked their movements during spring and autumn migrations of 2007-2009 to address the following objectives: (1) describe the spring migration routes of Pintails between Japan and Russia, and evaluate whether annual and individual variation in the migration of Asian Pintails was comparable to North American Pintails, (2) identify summer distribution and assess whether that distribution varied among years, (3) ascertain whether autumn migration routes were similar to those used in spring, and (4) examine the magnitude of Pintail migration from Asia to North America.

Extreme weather events have the potential to alter both short- and long-term population dynamics as well as community- and ecosystem-level function. Such events are rare and stochastic, making it difficult to fully document how organisms respond to them and predict the repercussions of similar events in the future.<br>
2. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which short-term events can incur long-term consequences, we documented the behavioural responses and fitness consequences for a long-distance migratory bird, the continental black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa limosa, resulting from a spring snowstorm and three-week period of record low temperatures.<br>
3. The event caused measurable responses at three spatial scales—continental, regional, and local—including migratory delays (+19 d), reverse migrations (>90 km), elevated metabolic costs (+8.8% maintenance metabolic rate), and increased foraging rates (+37%).<br>
4. There were few long-term fitness consequences, however, and subsequent breeding seasons instead witnessed high levels of reproductive success and little evidence of carry-over effects.<br>
5. This suggests that populations with continued access to food, behavioural flexibility, and time to dissipate the costs of the event can likely withstand the consequences of an extreme weather event. For populations constrained in one of these respects, though, extreme events may entail extreme ecological consequences.",research,NA,FALSE,49:30.0,15:34.0,17403,Limosa limosa,Argos Doppler Shift

North America with satellite tracking Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs) to document migration routes
and wintering range. Nineteen complete fall migration routes were documented for 17 individuals. Of the successful
migrations, 63% (n = 12) went to southern Florida, 32% (n = 6) to southern Louisiana, and 5% (n = 1) to
the Gulf coast of Texas. Spring migrations for nine birds were documented, and 78% (n = 7) showed fidelity to
breeding range. Two complete migrations for two individuals were documented, and they demonstrated fidelity to winter range. The longest, fastest movement documented was 2,300 km in less than 74 hr. Extensive, post-breeding dispersal was not observed in the adult male American Bitterns in this study. Six male American Bitterns were marked with PTTs on winter range in Florida and Texas. Spring migration for these birds was documented to Nebraska, North Dakota, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Sixty-seven American Bitterns were marked with
Very High Frequency radio transmitters on summer ranges, and 16% (n = 11) were located on wintering grounds
used by the satellite-tracked birds, further documenting the importance of the Everglades and the Louisiana coast
as winter habitat for American Bitterns that breed in Central North America.",research,NA,FALSE,45:00.0,39:05.0,1950,Botaurus lentiginosus,Argos Doppler Shift

Washington, DC 20008",rydert@si.edu,Thomas B. Ryder,"Seasonal migrations- the regular annual seasonal movements to specific destinations- are among the most fascinating of biological phenomena. In birds, well over half of temperate breeding species migrate to non-breeding locations in the tropics (Rappole 1995) and the degree to which these populations are linked is termed migratory connectivity (Webster et al. 2002, Marra et al. 2006). The linkages between the breeding and non-breeding season can have profound impacts when events from one season “carry-over” and affect events in another season (Marra et al. 1998). For example, dry non-breeding conditions may reduce food availability influencing departure timing, migratory performance and subsequent reproductive effort (Studds & Marra 2011, McKellar et al. 2013, Reudink et al. 2009). As such, characterizing migratory connectivity and seasonal interactions is essential for understanding complex population dynamics and can contribute to the management and conservation of migratory species (Webster & Marra 2005, Marra et al. 2010). Despite the importance of understanding how populations are linked, studying migratory connectivity and finer scale carry-over effects necessitates tracking individuals throughout the annual cycle across large geographic areas.
                  Technology has rapidly advanced our ability to track animals with higher spatial and temporal resolution (Bridge et al. 2011). Within the last five years alone, we have reduced uncertainty about where birds winter from ~150 km (i.e., light-level geolocators; Ryder et al. 2011) to near pin-point 10m accuracy (i.e., GPS geolocators; Hallworth & Marra 2015). This increased resolution allows researchers to track individuals to the non-breeding grounds and study populations that are truly demographically linked to understand how environmental conditions shape migratory timing, speed, arrival, and breeding reproductive performance. Among migratory birds, short-distance migrants that winter within the southern US and Caribbean are a tractable system to jointly study linked population on both ends of the annual cycle because non-breeding sites are more readily accessible. The Gray catbird (Dumatella carolinensis) is a common short-distance migrant breeding in Washington, DC that winters largely in Florida and Cuba (Ryder et al. 2011). Gray catbird abundance, appropriate body size for current tracking technology, and recognizable song make them a good model system for combining science and education about migration biology at the National Zoological Park.
                  Here, we propose a project that quantifies migratory connectivity and seasonal interactions for Gray catbirds using state-of-the-art tracking technology while concurrently educating the public about the grand phenomenon of migration. The projects overarching scientific and educational objectives are: 1) to characterize the migratory connectivity and locate the non-breeding grounds of gray catbirds breeding within the National Zoological park using GPS geolocators, 2) to examine how non-breeding environmental conditions influence reproductive performance in subsequent breeding seasons, 3) to develop informal educational presentations during live animal tagging and formal curriculum to educate the public about migration, and 4) to use the project experience, outreach, and data as a case study for the development and implementation of the tracking station and more broadly the Experience Migration exhibit.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,00:10.0,908,NA,GPS

2011 was key for marine protection in Portugal, as the Berlengas SPA was enlarged to include a significant proportion of its marine area.Decided to define and implement a legally-binding management plan with clear and measurable actions and targets, the Portuguese Government and SPEA (BirdLife International in Portugal), together with other partners, have
decided to join forces.
The Berlengas archipelago represents an unique opportunity to integrate seabird conservation with the sustainable use of one of Portugal's hottest tourist destinations.
Despite its vicinity to Peniche and the central Portuguese coastline, an area well known for beach based tourism and extreme sports such as kite surfing, diving and surf, the seabird populations of Berlengas are poorly known.
LIFE Berlengas main objectives are:
1-Understand the main threats affecting seabird populations and endemic plant species on land and at
sea (for seabirds) and define actions to minimise/eradicate them, including a long-term monitoring
scheme
2- Promote a sustainable use of the recently created Berlengas SPA, focusing on its main three
economic activities: Fisheries, Recreational activities and Tourism
3- Define the necessary monitoring framework for the completion and approval of the management
plan of Berlengas SPA.
Berlengas archipelago is the stronghold of the Shag breeding population in Portugal, with more than 60% of
the national population (Equipa Atlas 2008). The last survey conducted in 2012 revealed 82 pairs
concentrated mostly on Berlenga island and, compared with previous censuses, a decrease of ca. 10% was
observed (Lecoq et al. 2012).Data-logger devices will be placed for monitoring of seabird species nesting in Berlengas archipelago (Cory’s
shearwater, Madeiran storm-petrel, Yellow-legged gull and Shag). Devices will be selected in accordance with
the target species.

Geographical challenges such as desert and sea barriers and en route unforseen meteorological conditions may affect flight behaviour.

Exacerbating this problem is the fact that many species are extremely difficult to detect outside of breeding. Here, we demonstrate a partial solution to this problem by using archival GPS tags to examine the overwintering ecology of a migratory nocturnal bird, the eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferous). We deployed tags on 21 individuals and were able to recover 11 (52%) one year later. Tags collected high precision (approx. 10m) points throughout the nonbreeding period. With continuous time movement models, we used these data to estimate overwintering home ranges. All individuals exhibited at least one bounded home range during this phase of the annual cycle, three of eleven had two wintering locations, and home range area ranged from 0.50–10.85ha. All overwintering home ranges contained closed-canopy forest land cover (42-100%), and no other land cover type represented >40% of any home range.  We found some evidence, with caveats, that total edge within the landscape surrounding the home range was negatively related to home range area. The prevalence of contiguous closed-canopy forest cover in overwintering home ranges contrasts with apparent breeding habitat preferences, which includes clear cuts and other, more open, habitats. This study is the first to reveal key aspects of overwintering space use in this species by using archival GPS to overcome both logistical and methodological limitations.

Using six years of presence-absence data (2007–2012) spanning years of record-breaking drought and flood conditions, we evaluated regional occupancy dynamics of American mink (Neovison vison) and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) in a highly altered agroecosystem in Illinois, USA. We used noninvasive sign surveys and a multiseason occupancy modeling approach to estimate annual occupancy rates for both species and related these rates to summer precipitation. We also tracked radiomarked individuals to assess mortality risk for both species when moving in terrestrial areas. Annual model-averaged estimates of occupancy for mink and muskrat were correlated positively to summer precipitation. Mink and muskrats were widespread during a year (2008) with above-average precipitation. However, estimates of site occupancy declined substantially for mink (0.56) and especially muskrats (0.09) during the severe drought of 2012. Mink are generalist predators that probably use terrestrial habitat during droughts. However, mink had substantially greater risk of mortality away from streams. In comparison, muskrats are more restricted to aquatic habitats and likely suffered high mortality during the drought. Our patterns are striking, but a more mechanistic understanding is needed of how semiaquatic species in human-modified ecosystems will respond ecologically in situ to extreme weather events predicted by climate-change models.",research,NA,FALSE,15:00.0,51:00.0,2035,Neovison vison,Radio Transmitter

Specifically, we tested parameters that represent differences in movement strategies and efficiencies such as speed, distance and straightness in an overall, daily and hourly scale. Our preliminary analysis have revealed the effect of season on the migratory strategies and a combined diurnal and nocturnal migration flight strategy. Geographical challenges such as desert and sea barriers and unforeseen meteorological conditions may affect flight behaviour. We hypothesize that among lesser kestrel there is a strategic trade-off in migratory behaviour, from a broad-spectrum strategy which varies from energy-maximizers to time-minimizers and that is dependant upon ecological conditions.

The study was originally designed to identify seasonal distribution and migration patterns of mule deer during the early stages of coalbed methane development (Bureau of Land Management 2007). Phase 1 of the study (2005-2006) was followed by Phase 2 (2008-2011), where the same metrics were evaluated during a period of more intensive energy development (Sawyer and Nielson 2011). Information compiled from Phases 1 and 2 provided fine-scale movement and distribution data needed to refine seasonal range maps, delineate migratory corridors and stopover habitat (Sawyer et al. 2009, Sawyer and Kauffman 2011), and document behavioral impacts to migratory mule deer from energy development, including increased rates of movement and reduced stopover use (Sawyer et al. 2013, Wyckoff et al. 2018). The Bureau of Land Management implemented a final Phase 3 of the study (2014-2019) to monitor winter distribution and migratory patterns of mule deer through years where energy development had shifted primarily to production. Here, we summarize findings from Phase 3 and describe how data from all Phases of the Atlantic Rim Mule Deer Study have been used to advance knowledge of mule deer ecology.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,GPS

observable effects on migrant bird species, from Northern breeding areas

Eurasian oystercatcher abundance to the density of an invasive clam
species (Corbicula fluminea) and its potential role as biological control. As
a case study, the oystercatcher population fluctuations over a 30-year time
period, coupled with video-recorded estimates of its feeding behavior on C.
fluminea, and results from an exclosure experiment, were analyzed in the
NW of the Iberian Peninsula. Results showed that oystercatchers exert a
top-down control over C. fluminea density. In addition, oystercatchers
doubled its wintering numbers in a C. fluminea invaded estuary where they
actively feed upon this invasive clam. Given that, the facilitative interaction
between the invasive C. fluminea and the migratory Eurasian oystercatcher
seems to respond to bottom-up forces. Altogether, our results suggest that
control measures applied to long term biological invasions must be
carefully analyzed since non-native species may be sustaining dependent

Given the migratory tendencies of this species, it is plausible that blue-winged teal may disperse avian pathogens between spatially distant areas. To better understand the potential role of blue-winged teal in the exchange of avian pathogens between North America and areas further south, we collected information on migratory tendencies of this species and sampled birds at spatially distant areas during breeding and non-breeding periods. Forty-two adult, male blue-winged teal were captured and marked. Twelve birds were captured on their summer range in the Saskatchewan and Alberta Canadian Provinces during August 11-15, 2013, with the remaining thirty birds captured at wintering areas along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast in the United States during March 17-22, 2015. We selected only male blue-winged teal weighing ≥380 g for instrumentation. All birds were marked with 9.5 gram, solar-powered Platform Transmitter Terminals (PTTs) manufactured by Microwave Telemetry, Inc., Columbia, Maryland (USA) and released close to their respective capture locations. The PTTs were attached using a Teflon harness secured over the sternum to have a dorsally extended antenna. The PTTs were programmed with a 10 hour on 48 hour off duty cycle. Protocols for capturing, handling, and instrumenting blue-winged teal included in this study were reviewed by institutional animal care and use committees (USGS Alaska Science Center Animal Care and Use Committee Animal Use permit no. 2014-5, University of Saskatchewan Animal Use protocol no. 20070039) and carried out under federal authority (US Department of the Interior Federal Bird Banding permit nos. 09072 and 23792, Federal Fish and Wildlife permit no.

The air exercises involve aircraft flying at different heights on colonies of griffon vulture and broad areas of extensive and intensive livestock farming where vultures and other scavengers feed daily.  As a consequence of this bird strikes have occurred. In view of the problem it is advisable to initiate studies aimed at understanding the dynamics of use of space for griffon vultures in this region.

However, flexibility in migratory behavior may allow effective coping with unpredictable variation in ecological conditions that can occur during migration. We aimed at characterizing inter- and intraindividual variation of migratory behavior in a forest-dwelling wader species, the Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola, focusing on spatio-temporal consistency across repeated migration episodes. By satellite-tracking birds from their wintering sites along the Italian peninsula to their breeding areas, we disclosed a remarkable variability in migration distances, with some birds flying more than 6,000 km to Central Asian breeding grounds (up to 101°E). Prebreeding migration was faster and of shorter duration than postbreeding migration. Birds moving over longer distances migrated faster during prebreeding migration, and those breeding at northernmost latitudes left their wintering areas earlier. Moreover, birds making longer migrations departed earlier from their breeding sites. Breeding site fidelity was very high, whereas fidelity to wintering areas increased with age. Migration routes were significantly consistent, both among repeated migration episodes and between pre- and postbreeding migration. Prebreeding migration departure date was not significantly repeatable, whereas arrival date to the breeding areas was highly repeatable. Hence, interindividual variation in migratory behavior of woodcocks was mostly explained by the location of the breeding areas, and spatial consistency was relatively large through the entire annual cycle. Flexibility in prebreeding migration departure date may suggest that environmental effects have a larger influence on temporal than on spatial aspects of migratory behavior.",research,NA,FALSE,57:59.0,39:09.0,5923,Scolopax rusticola,Argos Doppler Shift

A recent experiment on Atlantic shearwaters (Cory’s shearwater, Calonectris borealis) breeding in the Azores indicated a crucial role of olfaction over the open ocean, but left open the question of whether birds might navigate by topographical landmark cues when available. Our experiment was conducted in the Mediterranean sea, where the availability of topographical cues may provide an alternative navigational mechanism for homing. Magnetically disturbed shearwaters and control birds oriented homeward even when the coast was not visible and rapidly homed. Anosmic shearwaters oriented in a direction significantly different from the home direction when in open sea. After having approached a coastline their flight path changed from convoluted to homeward oriented, so that most of them eventually reached home. Beside confirming that magnetic cues appear unimportant for oceanic navigation by seabirds, our results support the crucial role of olfactory cues for birds’ navigation and reveal that anosmic shearwaters are able to home eventually by following coastal features.",research,NA,FALSE,41:53.0,59:39.0,23159,Calonectris diomedea,"GPS,Argos Doppler Shift"

In many cases, birds do not migrate strait from breeding to non-breeding areas but fly via a detour. All western European populations of red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio are assumed to reach their southern African wintering grounds detouring via southeast Europe. Based on theoretical considerations under an optimality framework this detour is apparently optimal. Here, we use individual geolocator data on red-backed shrikes breeding in Spain to show that these birds do indeed detour via southeast Europe en route to southern Africa where they join other European populations of red-backed shrikes and return via a similar route in spring. Disregarding potential wind assistance, the routes taken for the tracked birds in autumn were not optimal compared to crossing the barrier directly. For spring migration the situation was quite different with the detour apparently being optimal. However, when considering potential wind assistance estimated total air distances during autumn migration were overall similar and the barrier crossing shorter along the observed routes. We conclude that considering the potential benefit of wind assistance makes the route via southeast Europe likely to be less risky in autumn. However, it cannot be ruled out that other factors, such as following a historical colonisation route could still be important.",research,NA,FALSE,30:00.0,25:00.0,4403,Lanius collurio,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw"

A geographic model of cat density was created based on local house density and distance from forest/neighborhood edge. IOHC hunted mostly small mammals, averaging 1.67 prey brought home/cat/month and a kill rate of 13%. Predation rates based on kills brought home was lower than the estimate from observing hunting cats (5.54 kills/cat/month). IOHC spent most outside time in their or their neighbors' yard, or in the nearby forest edge; 80% of observed hunts occurred in a yard or first 10m of forest. Radio-tracked IOHC averaged 0.24ha in home rang size (95% MCP) and rarely entered forest. Confirming this, scent stations detected cats more often near edge, and more cats were detected in smaller forest fragments. There was no relationship between the number of cats detected in an area and the local small mammal abundance or seed predation rates.

Given recent declines of long-distance migrant birds, multi-population tracking studies are crucial in order to assess the strength of migratory connectivity and to identify key sites en route. Here, we present the first large-scale analysis of migration patterns and migratory connectivity in the globally near-threatened European roller Coracias garrulus.<br>
Location: Breeding area: Europe; passage area: Mediterranean, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula; wintering area: southern Africa<br>
Methods: We synthesise new geolocator data with existing geolocator, satellite tag and ring recovery data from eight countries across Europe. We describe routes and stopover sites, analyse the spatial pattern of winter sites with respect to breeding origin, and quantify the strength of connectivity between breeding and winter sites.<br>
Results: We demonstrate the importance of the northern savannah zone as a stopover region and reveal the easterly spring loop (via Arabia) and leap-frog migration of rollers from eastern populations. Whilst there was some overlap between individuals from different populations over winter, their distribution was non-random, with positive correlations between breeding and autumn/winter longitude as well as between pairwise distance matrices of breeding and winter sites. Connectivity was stronger for eastern populations than western ones.<br>
Main conclusions: The moderate levels of connectivity detected here may increase the resilience of breeding populations to localised habitat loss on the winter quarters. We also highlight passage regions crucial for the successful conservation of Roller populations, including the Sahel/Sudan savannah for all populations, and the Horn of Africa/Arabian Peninsula for north-eastern rollers.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,Coracias garrulus,Solar Geolocator Raw

Fig. 2. Illustration of presumed diurnal movement on 12–13 September 2015 by male Yellow Warbler
#132, probably across the Yucatan Channel between western Cuba and Mexico/Belize. Note smooth
light transitions on 12 September. The smooth transitions continued onto the morning of 13 September,
suggesting a flight duration of > 24 h. Light transitions are more jagged on days preceding and after the
flight because a foraging bird moves in and out of vegetation, thus affecting light levels recorded by the
geolocator.

The signal from another one was lost on the territory without coverage area, another bird was caught in Iraq and its fate remains unknown, and the last one crashed into powerline wires in Saudi Arabia and was taken to the rehabilitation center. Our data showed that Dagestan Egyptian Vultures use same migration routes that were already known for Transcaucasian birds.

Yet, despite recent advances in tracking technology, we lack comprehensive information on the spatial structure of migratory networks across a species’ range, particularly for small-bodied, long-distance migratory animals. We constructed a migratory network for a songbird and used network-based metrics to characterize the spatial structure and prioritize regions for conservation. The network was constructed using year-round movements derived from 133 archival light-level geolocators attached to Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) originating from 12 breeding sites across their North American breeding range. From these breeding sites, we identified 10 autumn stopover nodes (regions) in North America, 13 non-breeding nodes located around the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean, and 136 unique edges (migratory routes) connecting nodes. We found strong migratory connectivity between breeding and autumn stopover sites and moderate migratory connectivity between the breeding and non-breeding sites. We identified three distinct ‘communities’ of nodes that corresponded to western, central, and eastern North American flyways. Several regions were important for maintaining network connectivity, with South Florida and Louisiana as the top ranked non-breeding nodes and the Midwest as the top ranked stopover node. We show that migratory songbird networks can have both a high degree of mixing between seasons yet still show regionally distinct migratory flyways. Such information will be crucial for accurately predicting factors that limit and regulate migratory songbirds throughout the annual cycle. Our study highlights how network-based metrics can be valuable for identifying overall network structure and prioritizing specific regions within a network for conserving a wide variety of migratory animals.",research,NA,FALSE,05:00.0,13:00.0,78545,Tachycineta bicolor,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw"

Our initial samples were 34 Swainson's Hawks from representative areas of their breeding range, and 61 Peregrine Falcons captured at nest sites across the North American boreal forest and low Arctic or on the migration routes along the mid-Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The average distance of migration for Peregrines was 8,624 km southward, and 8,247 km northward. Peregrines travelled at an average rate of 172 km/d southward and 198 km/d going north. Peregrine Falcons used at least three broad, general routes south from the breeding areas, and individuals stopped migrating as far north as the U.S.A. mid-Atlantic coast and as far south as central Argentina. The radiomarked Peregrine Falcons used coastal routes, mid-continental routes, and water-crossing routes: the Davis Strait and Caribbean Sea. During northward migration, Peregrines migrating through at Padre Island, Texas diverged for destinations from central Alaska across the continent to central West Greenland. Swainson's Hawks migrated an average of about 13,504 km southward and 11,952 km northward, and travelled 188 km/d southward and 150 km/d northward. Swainson's Hawks converged in eastern Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico coast.

home range) and those used most intensely (utilization distribution) based on location
data. However, few have extended these models beyond their traditional roles as
descriptive 2D summaries of point data. Here we demonstrate how the home range
method, T-LoCoH can be expanded to quantify collective
sampling coverage by multiple instrumented animals using grey seals (Halichoerus
grypus) equipped with GPS tags and acoustic transceivers on the Scotian Shelf

The Eurasian Griffon vulture is among the largest raptors in Europe. It feeds exclusively on dead mammals. The species had been reintroduced in Southern Alps in 1996 and it is still in the process of colonization of the Alps.
This study aims at investigating flight behaviour of Eurasian griffon vultures in European moutains. We deployed in December 2014-Jan 2016 7 units from e-obs (GPS-GSM-GPRS) to 7 adults. the loggers are programmed to record tracks with high resolution (1Hz) coupled with accelerometer to record body posture. The tracks are also used to analyse how vultures use space according to seasons, how does it overlap human landscape and obstacles (power lines), and how and where do they find carcasses (at feeding stations or in alpine meadows).",research,NA,TRUE,30:06.0,15:00.0,9537041,Gyps fulvus,"GPS,Acceleration"

However, the difficulty of tracking small birds between breeding and wintering areas has hindered progress in this area. To learn more about Kirtland’s Warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) movement patterns throughout the annual cycle, we deployed archival light-level geolocators across the breeding range in Michigan. We recovered devices from 27 males and analyzed light-level data within a Bayesian framework. We found that most males wintered in the central Bahamas and exhibited a loop migration pattern. In both fall and spring, departure date was the strongest predictor of arrival date, though in spring, stopover duration and migration distance were also important. Though stopover strategies varied, males spent the majority of their spring migration at stopover sites, several of which were located just before or after large ecological barriers. We argue that loop migration is likely a response to seasonal variation in prevailing winds. By documenting a tight link between spring departure and arrival dates, we provide a plausible mechanism for previously documented carry-over effects of winter rainfall on reproductive success in this species. The migratory periods remain the least understood periods for all birds, but by describing Kirtland’s Warbler migration routes and timing, and identifying locations of stopover sites, we have begun the process of better understanding the dynamics of their full annual cycle. Moreover, we have provided managers with valuable information on which to base future conservation and research priorities.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,Setophaga,Solar Geolocator Raw

We evaluated performance of traditional and snapshot micro-GPS (< 20 g) receivers on a small, semi-fossorial lagomorph, the pygmy rabbit, to understand how GPS errors might influence fine-scale assessments of space use and habitat selection. During stationary tests, microtopography and satellite geometry had the largest influence on GPS fix success rate (FSR) and location error (LE). There was no difference between FSR while animals wore the GPS collars above ground and FSR generated during stationary, above-ground trials, suggesting that animal behavior other than burrowing did not markedly influence micro-GPS errors. In our study, traditional micro-GPS receivers demonstrated similar FSR and LE to snapshot receivers, however, snapshot receivers operated inconsistently due to battery and software failures. In contrast, the initial traditional receivers deployed on animals experienced some breakages, but a modified collar design consistently functioned as expected.

In this context we characterise the land occupation strategies of a Western Atlantic French coastal endemic bird: the Bluethroat Cyanecula svecica namnetum. Our study focuses on a key period of the life cycle of this species: the post-breeding moult. Capture and recapture sessions in intertidal habitats have allowed us to retrieve 26% of local breeders during their moulting period. The modeling of moult kinetics revealed that moult of flight feathers takes 37-50 days. A radio-tracking survey of moulting birds revealed exploitation by individuals of both the lowest and tallest vegetal formations of intertidal sites and exploitation of small home ranges (0.42-1.34 ha), typical of locations where trophic resources tend to be abundant and predictable. Analyses of droppings highlighted that Coleoptera, Aranea and marine crustaceans (Amphipoda) contributed most of the prey biomass consumed, amphipods being particularly selected by birds in active moult. Our results underline the importance of intertidal wetlands in terms of trophic opportunities to compensate for the energy costs of moult for the Bluethroat. Given the global changes already dramatically affecting coastal habitats, we emphasise that special attention should be given to the conservation of intertidal wetlands for marshland passerines of conservation concern such as the Bluethroat, and that restoration of adjacent coastal terrain is a promising development.",research,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Olympia, WA 98501",Matthew.Wilson@dfw.wa.gov,Matt Wilson,"Project Description

Management of Taverner’s cackling geese (""Taverner’s"") and lesser Canada Geese (""Lessers"") is confounded by difficulties delineating these subspecies on the breeding grounds due to similar morphological characteristics and undefined breeding ranges. The Pacific Flyway has been unable to finalize a management plan for Lessers and Taverner’s due to the inability to define and monitor these populations. Of particular concern, past marking projects of Lessers staging in interior Alaska and wintering in eastern Washington and Oregon found annual survival rates among the lowest and recovery rates among the highest for comparable populations of marked geese (Eichholz and Sedinger 2007). Delineation of the nesting grounds of these two goose populations, coupled with ongoing genetics research, is critical to the responsible management of Arctic-nesting small Canada geese. 

Project Objectives
1.Utilize satellite platform terminal transmitters (PTTs) to augment efforts to delineate the range of Taverner’s and Lessers.
2.Provide DNA samples to delineate breeding grounds based on genetic differentiation.  
3.Contribute to harvest information knowledge of Taverner’s and Lessers in the Columbia Basin by conducting annual fall and spring banding efforts.  
4.Collect morphological data on captured geese which, in association with genetics information, will enhance morphometric discrimination of Taverner’s and Lessers in the field. 

Key Findings 
•Since spring 2010, we have implanted 21 PTTs in adult female small Canada geese, including 12 spring and 9 fall deployments. We tracked the study subjects to their breeding grounds in northwestern Alaska for the summer (see breeding area map). The birds used breeding and molting sites near Kotzebue Sound, Bering Land Bridge, and the Lisburne Peninsula. They returned to eastern Washington in late October and early November. Most of the geese migrated down the British Columbia coastline, with the exception of one bird which migrated inland through central B.C. Contrary to expectations, none of the study subjects transmitted from known small Canada goose staging areas near Fairbanks, AK. As of September 2013, none of transmitters are active.  The last location was received in July 2013.
•Preliminary DNA analysis from the USGS Alaska Science Center indicates 5 of the 7 study subjects were “small-bodied haplotypes”, or Taverner’s. The other 2 “large-bodied haplotypes” were Lessers. 
•To date, we have received 92 reports of harvested geese from our banded sample. Five banded geese were recovered during the Alaska spring subsistence harvest, including one carrying a PTT.

Together with our collaborators at NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Point Adams Field Station (Dr. Jen Zamon), University of Washington (Elizabeth Phillips), and Oregon State University (Stephanie Loredo) we conducted night-time captures at sea using an inflatable skiff, spotlight, and dip-net. We transported captured murres to our mother vessel, the M/V Forerunner operated by the Clatsop Community College, Marine and Environmental Research and Training Station (MERTS) for satellite transmitter attachments and subsequent release approximately 3 miles off the Columbia River mouth. Foraging aggregations of murres are commonly observed near the mouth of the Columbia River. Densities here can often exceed 50 birds per square km, making them the one of the most conspicuous and abundant piscivourous seabird predators in the region. Aggregations often are observed feeding at the turbulent boundary between fresh river water and salty ocean water (the “plume front”). Young salmon migrating out of the Columbia River must successfully pass through this boundary to begin their ocean phase of life. To develop an understanding of how murres and young salmon interact in the plume environment, this project used satellite tags and ship-and aircraft-based ocean surveys to gather information about Common Murre habitat use, diet, movements and residency time in the Columbia River region.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The solution is to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions in the atmosphere moving upwards with a speed exceeding the descent rate of bird and plane. Whereas birds use this technique mainly for foraging, humans do it as a sporting activity. Thermalling involves efficient optimization including the skillful localization of thermals, trying to guess the most favorable route, estimating the best descending rate, etc. In this study, we address the question whether there are any analogies between the solutions birds and humans find to handle the above task. High-resolution track logs were taken from thermalling falcons and paraglider pilots to determine the essential parameters of the flight patterns. We find that there are relevant common features in the ways birds and humans use thermals.

Overlap areas were calculated as dynamic Brownian bridges of stopover, nest and moulting sites.
Results: Utilisation areas of the two populations overlapped only somewhat during spring and autumn migration stopovers, but much during moult. During this stage, non-breeders and failed breeders of the North Sea population intermixed with geese from the Pannonic population in the Pyasina delta on Taimyr peninsula. The timing of use of overlap areas was highly consistent between populations, making exchange possible. Two of our tracked geese switched from the North Sea population flyway to the Pannonic flyway during moult on Taimyr peninsula or early during the subsequent autumn migration. Because we could follow one of them during the next year, where it stayed in the Pannonic flyway, we suggest that the exchange was long-term or permanent.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,45:29.0,118744,Anser albifrons,GPS

We quantified the repeatability of leadership-based flock structures within a flight and across multiple flights conducted with the same animals. We compared two contexts of flock composition: flocks of birds of the same age and flight experience; and, flocks of birds of different ages and flight experience. All flocks displayed consistent leadership-based structures over time, showing that individuals have stable roles in the navigational decisions of the flock. However, flocks of balanced age and flight experience exhibited reduced leadership stability, indicating that these factors promote flock structuring. Our study empirically demonstrates that leadership and followership are consistent behaviours in homing pigeon flocks, but such consistency is affected by the heterogeneity of individual flight experiences and/or age.

Williamsburg, VA 23187",fmsmit@wm.edu,Fletcher Smith,"The whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) is a large, highly migratory shorebird that breeds in arctic and sub-arctic latitudes and winters in the tropics. The North American race (N.p. hudsonicus) includes three disjunct breeding populations, all of which winter primarily in Central and South America. The two rufiventris populations breed in Alaska and the Northwest Territories of Canada (Engelmoer and Roselaar 1998). These western whimbrels primarily use different migration routes and wintering grounds and are most likely genetically segregated populations (CCB/CWS unpublished tracking data). The hudsonicus population breeds in the Hudson Bay Lowlands along the James and Hudson Bays (Jehl and Smith 1970, Skeel and Mallory 1996). The populations of whimbrels utilizing the Atlantic Coast and northeast South America have declined by up to 50% in recent decades (Watts and Truitt 2011, and RIG Morrison et al., unpublished data, from Andres et al. 2012) and both the hudsonicus and Northwest Territories rufiventris populations are of conservation concern (Morrison 2006, Bart et al. 2007, Watts and Truitt 2011).
In an effort to better understand the population size and habitat use of whimbrels utilizing the Acadian peninsula during fall migration, we designed aerial and ground based surveys to accomplish this goal. We detected 339 whimbrels during the first aerial survey and 615 during the second survey. Whimbrels were distributed along the peninsula from Brantville to Miscou Island, though concentrations of whimbrels were higher near Miscou Island. Of the 954 whimbrels detected on aerial surveys, 908 (95%) were observed in harvest stage fields, 5 (<1%) in development stage fields, 7 (<1%) flushed from unknown stage fields, and 34 (3.5%) from coastal beaches or barrier islands. We surveyed 103 ground transects twice each during the field season. We surveyed a total length of 58.5 km of transects within the five geographic areas (Brantville, Lord and Foy, Val-Doucet, Tracadie-Sheila, and Pigeon Hill/Lameque Island). We surveyed approximately 1,448 hectares of blueberry fields, with 773ha in active blueberry production, 653ha in growth stage, and 32ha in development. A total of 690 whimbrels were detected in the two survey rounds, with majority of detections in harvest stage fields (N=637, 92%), and 53 detections (8%) in either growth or development stage. A total of 565 (82%) whimbrels detected during survey round 1, and 125 (18%) during survey round 2.
The Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick, Canada appears to support a significant portion of the total whimbrel population that uses Atlantic Canada in fall migration. Over 99% of all whimbrels detected during the aerial, ground, and evening roost surveys originated from blueberry fields, suggesting that tidal influences on behavior are negligible. Warden pressure on the whimbrels in the blueberry fields is quite high and needs to be addressed.

Bats were tracked for their full foraging session (87.27 ± 24 mins) using high-resolution atmospheric pressure radio transmitters that allowed us to calculate height and wingbeat frequency. Bats used diverse flight strategies, but generally flew lower than 40 m, with scouting flights to 100 m and a maximum of 300 m. We found no influence of weather on height and high-altitude ascents were not preceded by an increase in foraging effort. Wingbeat frequency was independent from climbing or descending flight, and bats skipped wingbeats or glided in 10% of all observations. Wingbeat frequency was positively related to capture mass, and wingbeat frequency was positively related to time of night, indicating an effect of load increase over a foraging bout.

Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25–43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. .45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,30:00.0,116,Animalia,Radio Transmitter

Summary
1. Tracking return migrations in songbirds has been impossible until recently when miniaturization of light-level loggers enabled observation of the first complete round trip. Although geolocators are extensively used on animals at sea, little is known about how accurate geolocators are for tracking terrestrial or forest-dwelling migrants.
2. To test the accuracy of geolocators for tracking migratory songbirds living in forested habitat, we calibrated geolocators to a source population located in central Europe and collected location estimates based on the source population calibration from stationary geolocators deployed over an 800 km NE to SW gradient in Western Europe. Additionally, we fit non-migratory songbirds (European blackbirds, Turdus merula) with geolocators for 12 months to compare known locations of individuals with locations estimated by geolocators.
3. We found an average error ±95% CI of 201 ± 43 km in latitude for stationary geolocators in forest habitat. Longitude error was considerably lower (12 ± 03 km). The most accurate geoloca- tor was on average 23 km off target, the worst was on average 390 km off. 
4. The winter latitude estimate error for geolocators deployed on sedentary birds was on average (±95% CI) 143 ± 62 km when geolocators were calibrated during the breeding season and 132 ± 75 km when they were calibrated during the winter. Longitude error for geolocators deployed on birds was on average (±95% CI) 50 ± 34 km.
5. Although we found error most likely due to seasonal changes in habitat and behaviour, our results indicate that geolocators can be used to reliably track long-distance forest-dwelling migrants. We also found that the low degree of error for longitude estimates attained from geolocators makes this technology suitable for identifying relatively short-distance movements in longitude.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw"

Apart of this individual, only some wild and semi-wild sedentary free-flying colonies and several zoo colonies are remaining. 

For 10 years, the Waldrappteam and its partners particular aim is to preserve the NBI as a migratory species from extinction, by creating new Migration traditions with descendants of European Zoo-Populations. A first migratory colony could be established. The birds breed in Burghausen/Bavaria and winter in the WWF Oasi Laguna di Orbetello/Tuscany. 

In 2014 a project, co-financed by the European Commission (LIFE+), starts. It aims to establish three migratory NBI colonies in Europe, with breeding areas north of the Alps and a common migration tradition to a wintering area in the southern Tuscany/Italy. 

All birds are equipped with GPS tags. The major aim for tagging is to implement actions against illegal hunting in Italy, the major threat for the free-flying birds. Two birds are currently tagged with solar-tags provided by the MPIAB. Our aim for the near future is to publish the majority of track via Movebank. 

The migration corridor ranges from Bavaria to the southern Tuscany, directly across the Alps and the Apennine.

This population of snow geese have traditionally used very discrete estuary and agricultural habitats associated with Skagit and Port Susan Bays.

The breeding grounds of this population are on Wrangel Island, Russia. Because Wrangel Island snow geese represent the last major snow goose population breeding in Asia, and the primary Russian goose population that winters in North America, it is a high priority for the Pacific Flyway and the subject of long standing international cooperative management and conservation. Data collected since the early 1970s on Wrangel Island indicates that the population has grown in abundance, become younger, and changed its behavior relative to traditional habitat and resources. These population changes have become more apparent since the early 1990s and appear to be in response to warmer spring conditions, earlier snowmelt, and changes in the predator community on Wrangel Island. Some of these changes are also evident in the NPS wintering population where the total overwintering population size has increased.

The objectives of this project are to examine the current relationship of the NPS population to other Pacific flyway use areas. This will include documentation of migration routes, phenology, staging areas, and stopover locations throughout the flyway. Particular questions that we hope to answer include: <br>

- When do geese depart and return to NPS during spring and fall migration?
<br>
- Where are important flyway use areas during migration?
<br>
- When and how long do geese use areas along migration routes?
<br>
- Document inter and/or intra-year interchange among NPS and other wintering areas.
<br>
- Do some geese that use NPS move to other locations within the flyway during the same winter or among different years?
<br>
- If NPS geese are moving to other locations, what is the timing of emigration and potential return to NPS?
<br>
The transmitters are programmed to transmit for three years.

One working package of the project is dedicated to the topic of bird collision mitigation at wind turbines. Flight movements of Red Kites are recorded with GPS-loggers and/or a laser-range-finder before and after the construction of the research wind turbines and will be linked to meteorological data in order to identify conditions with high collision risk. Furthermore, flight movement data are used to test the function of different automatic bird detection systems. The results of the tests will be used as a base for elaborating a profile of realistic requirements for automatic bird detection systems in order to set standards in the context of bird protection and nature conservation regarding bird collisions at wind turbines.

Uncovering the level of migratory connectivity is crucial for effective conservation actions and for understanding of the evolution of local adaptations and migratory routes. Here we investigate migration patterns in a passerine bird, the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, over its wide Western Palearctic breeding range using geolocators from Spain, Sweden, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Turkey. We found moderate migratory connectivity: a highly significant spatial structure in the connections between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding grounds, but at the same time a partial overlap between individual populations, particularly along the Gulf of Guinea where the majority of birds from the Spanish, Swedish and Czech populations spent their non-breeding period. The post-breeding migration routes were similar in direction and rather parallel for the five populations. Birds from Turkey showed the most distinctive migratory routes and sub-Saharan non-breeding range, with a post-breeding migration to East Africa and, together with birds from Bulgaria, a previously unknown pre-breeding migration over the Arabian Peninsula indicating counter-clockwise loop migration. The distances between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, as well as between first and final sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, differed among populations. Moreover, the total speed of migration did not differ significantly between populations during both the post-breeding migration in autumn as well as during pre-breeding migration in spring. There was also no significant relationship between the total speed of migration and distance between breeding and non-breeding sites (neither post- nor pre-breeding) and, surprisingly, the total speed of migration generally did not differ significantly between post-breeding and pre-breeding migration. Future challenges include understanding whether non-breeding environmental conditions may have influenced the differences in migratory patterns that we observed between populations, and to which extent non-breeding habitat fluctuations and loss may affect population sizes of migrants.",research,NA,FALSE,43:00.0,09:00.0,10318,NA,Solar Geolocator

The composition of the mixed population at a migratory divide and the corresponding non-breeding ranges remain, however, unknown for many Palaearctic-African migrants. Here, we used light-level geolocation to track migration direction and non-breeding grounds of Eurasian reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) from three breeding populations across the species’ migratory divide. Moreover, by using feathers grown at non-breeding grounds, we quantified stable isotope composition for individuals with known southwestern (SW) and southeastern (SE) migration directions. On a larger sample per population, we then assessed the proportions of SW- and SE-migrating phenotypes in each of the three populations. All tracked reed warblers from Germany and two thirds of the birds tagged from the Czech population headed initially SW. Nevertheless, about one third of the birds from the Czech site migrated towards SE. No tracking data have been obtained for the Bulgarian population. The initial migration direction determined by geolocators was a strong predictor of the non-breeding region, with SW migrants staying in West Africa and SE migrants in Central Africa. Feather δ34S and δ15N values confirmed the predominance of SW migrants in the German population, the co-occurrence of SW and SE migrants in the Czech population, and indicated a high (72%) proportion of SE migrants in the Bulgarian population. Thus, the combined approach of geolocator tracking and stable isotopic assignments provided clear evidence for the existence of a migratory divide in the southeast of Central Europe and predicted non-breeding range in Central and Central-Eastern Africa for the eastern population.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the winter range of this subspecies is not well understood, so we fitted 29 males with archival GPS tags during summer 2016. Four tagged thrushes were recaptured in summer 2017 and, though all tags had missing locations and broken antennae, the data retrieved showed that one thrush wintered in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM) in northern Colombia, one in the nearby Sierra de Perijá in Venezuela, and a third may have settled in the same region. One tag provided locations until April 21 and that thrush was consistently detected within a ~1 ha area through the winter. Locations obtained during fall migration indicated that thrushes travelled to South America via Central America and possibly by directly crossing the Caribbean. Contemporary research indicates that the SNSM is an important migratory stopover for Northern Gray-cheeked Thrushes (C. m. aliciae) but a historical report coupled with our observations suggest winter use of the SNSM and adjacent areas in northern South America by C. m. minimus, though numbers may be lower than during the 1900s.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,57:00.0,15,Catharus minimus,GPS

We discovered weak migratory connectivity at the roost scale, and extensive, fine-scale mixing of birds in the Amazon from distant (>2000 km) breeding sites, with some individuals sharing the same roosting trees. Despite vast tracts of contiguous forest in this region, birds occupied a much more limited habitat, with most (56%) roosts occurring on small habitat islands that were strongly associated with water.

We worked with citizen scientists to track 925 pet cats from six countries, finding remarkably small home ranges (3.6 ± 5.6 ha). Only three cats ranged > 1 km^2 and we found no relationship between home range size and the presence of larger native predators (i.e. coyotes, Canis latrans). Most (75%) cats used primarily (90%) disturbed habitats. Owners reported that their pets killed an average of 3.5 prey items/month, leading to an estimated ecological impact per cat of 14.2‐38.9 prey ha^−1 yr^−1. This is similar or higher than the per‐animal ecological impact of wild carnivores but the effect is amplified by the high density of cats in neighborhoods.

The Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata is globally Near Threatened and considered one of the UK’s most pressing avian conservation priorities. Designing effective conservation interventions and prioritising site protection requires knowledge of the habitat requirements of breeding Curlews, inside and outside of designated sites. The Exe and Taw-Torridge Estuaries, in South-West England are both designated Special Protection Areas (SPA), qualifying in part because each support nationally important numbers of wintering waders and waterbirds. Part of this assemblage are Eurasian Curlew and due to concerns regarding their population trend, this partnership project was established. This tracking study will investigate, in high detail, the use and relative importance of estuary sites as well as functionally linked non-designated habitats and where possible shed light on the migration routes and breed sites used by Curlews wintering in South-west England.  This information will be used to inform local conservation policy and management.

Furthermore, migratory connectivity – the connections made by migrating individuals between networks of breeding and non-breeding sites – has important implications for population dynamics. The Whinchat Saxicola rubetra is declining across its range, and tracking data from a single African non-breeding site implies high migratory spread. Here, we use geolocators to describe the migration routes and non-breeding areas of 20 Whinchats from three British breeding populations. As expected, migratory spread was high, with birds from the three populations overlapping across a wide area of West Africa. On average, in non-breeding areas British Whinchats were located 652 km apart from one another, with some likely to share non-breeding areas with individuals from breeding populations as far east as Russia. Four males made a direct non-breeding season movement to a second, more westerly, non-breeding location in January. Autumn migration was through Iberia and around the western edge of the Sahara Desert, whereas spring migration was more direct, indicating an anti-clockwise loop migration. Weak migratory connectivity implies that Whinchat populations are somewhat buffered against local changes in non-breeding conditions. If non-breeding season processes have played a role in the species’ decline, then large-scale drivers are likely to be the cause, though processes operating on migration, or interactions between breeding and non-breeding processes, cannot be ruled out.",research,NA,FALSE,04:00.0,26:38.0,13056,Saxicola rubetra,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw"

What information individuals use for movement coordination is, however, very difficult to know, except for echolocating bats. These flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high-pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes. Because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision, we can accurately measure the biosonar calls of interacting bats with a group of microphones and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived. When observing pairs of Daubenton's bats foraging low over water for stranded insects, we found they have intriguing `traffic rules' - they chase each other, perform tandem turns and even slow down to avoid collision. When we then modelled their biosonar view of the surroundings during these interactions we discovered that one simple trick suffices to create all their interactive behaviours: once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo, copy this individual's flight direction within 4-5 of your own wingbeats.<br>NOTE: Sensor type is 2D videogrammetry, not GPS.

However, inappropriate payload distribution is critical in aircraft and, since birds and planes are subject to the same laws of physics during flight, we considered aircraft aerodynamic constraints to explain flight patterns displayed by northern gannets Sula bassana equipped with (small ca. 14 g) tail- and back-mounted accelerometers and (larger ca.  30 g) tail-mounted GPS units. Tail-mounted GPS-fitted birds showed significantly higher cumulative numbers of flap-glide cycles and a higher pitch angle of the tail than accelerometer-equipped birds, indicating problems with balancing inappropriately placed weights with knock-on consequences relating to energy expenditure.

The spatial structure and dynamic properties of animal migrations and population flyways largely determine those trophic and transport effects, but are yet poorly studied. As a basis, we propose a periodic Markov model on the spatial migration network of breeding, stopover and wintering sites to formally describe the process of animal migration on the population level. From seasonally changing transition rates we derived stable, seasonal densities of animals at the network nodes. We parametrized the model with high-quality GPS and satellite telemetry tracks of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and greater white-fronted geese (Anser a. albifrons). Topological and network flow properties of the two derived networks conform to migration properties like seasonally changing connectivity and shared, directed movement. Thus, the model realistically describes the migration movement of complete populations and can become an important tool to study the effects of climate and habitat change and pathogen spread on migratory animals. Furthermore, the property of periodically changing transition rates makes it a new type of complex model and we need to understand its dynamic properties.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,11:52.0,11806,Anser albifrons,"GPS,Argos Doppler Shift"

However, the energy costs of flying are considerably higher than those of resting. Therefore, when birds fly off after a disturbance, they use extra energy that subsequently needs to be compensated. We measured flight durations of the white-fronted goose, the most common (grass-eating) species wintering in western Europe, by high-frequency accelerometer recordings and made direct observations on these days to determine whether the flight durations were reliably recorded. Using both a simple and a more realistic model of the energy balance, we calculated the extra grass consumption resulting from additional intentional disturbances.
On average, the geese flew daily 2 × 323 s (from and to their roosting sites at 3200 m), and furthermore took to the air 5.3 times during a day (and 1.9 times a night). Multiplied with the average flight durations of 195 s, this gives a total flying time of almost 0.6 h day-1 and a total foraging time of 7.4 h day-1. With an intentional disturbance rate e.g. of five times a day, the birds’ compensation for the increased energy expenditure will lead to a higher overall consumption of grass of 11.5–16 % day-1.

",CUSTOM,52,-122.5,Migration Patterns of Pacific Sea Ducks,423,423,396,NA,NA,NA,"Connectivity among annual cycle stages, rates of site fidelity, and the geographic scale of dispersal are largely unknown for Pacific Barrow’s Goldeneye (BAGO). This precludes researchers from identifying demographically discrete units for population management and understanding the scale of inference from field studies. Further, habitats and specific sites that may be particularly important for BAGO are difficult to identify, as this species is not well covered by surveys for most of its annual cycle and range.

Our research addresses the following questions:

1) What are the rates, and geographic scale, of inter-annual site fidelity by all sex and age classes at various stages of the annual cycle? 

2) Do birds from the same breeding site occur in discrete areas during winter, or     are they widely distributed, and vice versa? 

3) How do the answers to 1 and 2 above combine to indicate demographically distinct management units?
4) Are there important habitats or specific sites that are used by a large proportion of marked birds, which would indicate their value for conservation?

From 2006 to 2012, we deployed 267 satellite transmitters (PTTs) on BAGO at five sites in British Columbia, Alberta, and Alaska.",research,NA,FALSE,19:50.0,11:35.0,28088,"Bucephala islandica,Histrionicus histrionicus,Melanitta perspicillata",Argos Doppler Shift

GPS loggers recorded locations every 15 seconds. Bats used mainly waterbodies for foraging. With increasing moonlight, they switch from flying above to flying underneath the forest canopy, possibly as a predator avoidance strategy. Interestingly, the foraged above open fields (grass, arable) more often when the moon was bright, proposing that predator avoidance played a rather minor role here. We propose that open-space foraging bats are highly flexible in their spatio-temporal habitat use, allowing them to exploit cyclic appearing insect swarms which may be lured into the open under bright moonlight conditions. Further, bats repeatedly flew at altitudes higher than 70 m above canopy or open fields.

When predators are removed, re-colonization for some species occurs naturally, and inter-island phylogeographic relationships and current movement patterns can illuminate processes of colonization. We studied a case of re-colonization of common eiders (Somateria mollissima) following removal of introduced arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) in the Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska. We expected common eiders to resume nesting on islands cleared of foxes and to re-colonize from nearby islets, islands, and island groups. We thus expected common eiders to show limited genetic structure indicative of extensive mixing among island populations. Satellite telemetry was used to record current movement patterns of female common eiders from six islands across three island groups. We collected genetic data from these and other nesting common eiders at 14 microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial DNA control region to examine population genetic structure, historical fluctuations in population demography, and gene flow. Our results suggest recent interchange among islands. Analysis of microsatellite data supports satellite telemetry data of increased dispersal of common eiders to nearby areas and little between island groups. Although evidence from mtDNA is suggestive of female dispersal among island groups, gene flow is insufficient to account for recolonization and rapid population growth. Instead, near-by remnant populations of common eiders contributed substantially to population expansion, without which re-colonization would have likely occurred at a much lower rate. Genetic and morphometric data of common eiders within one island group two and three decades after re-colonization suggests reduced movement of eiders among islands and little movement between island groups after populations were re-established. We predict that re-colonization of an island group where all common eiders are extirpated could take decades.",research,NA,FALSE,51:25.0,35:34.0,16239,Somateria mollissima,"Argos Doppler Shift,Accessory Measurements"

Juveniles did not compensate for increased flight costs by increased refueling or resting during migration.

Overlap areas were calculated as dynamic Brownian bridges of stopover, nest and moulting sites.
Results: Utilisation areas of the two populations overlapped only somewhat during spring and autumn migration stopovers, but much during moult. During this stage, non-breeders and failed breeders of the North Sea population intermixed with geese from the Pannonic population in the Pyasina delta on Taimyr peninsula. The timing of use of overlap areas was highly consistent between populations, making exchange possible. Two of our tracked geese switched from the North Sea population flyway to the Pannonic flyway during moult on Taimyr peninsula or early during the subsequent autumn migration. Because we could follow one of them during the next year, where it stayed in the Pannonic flyway, we suggest that the exchange was long-term or permanent.",research,NA,FALSE,00:06.0,30:32.0,1086662,Anser albifrons,GPS

Murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiquus), of which half of the world's population breeds
in Haida Gwaii, BC, are especially susceptible to oiling during the period immediately
after departing from their breeding colonies, as their offspring are flightless for more
than a month, constraining their parents to remain with them. In 2014 we deployed
geolocator loggers on breeding Ancient Murrelets at four colonies, two on the east and
two on the west coast of Haida Gwaii to investigate patterns of post-breeding dispersal
and subsequent migratory movements. Birds from east coast colonies moved south
and east after leaving their colonies, remaining in Queen Charlotte Sound and adjacent
waters for 4-6 weeks. Those from the west coast colonies moved north and west and
mostly continued in the same direction, so that they left BC waters earlier than those
from east coast colonies. This initial period of slow movement, presumably while chicks
were flightless, was consistent with being driven by surface currents. In June, with
brood-rearing apparently completed, all birds moved rapidly to the eastern Aleutians
and SE Bering Sea, some continuing to waters off Kamchatka. Moult probably started
soon after this rapid migration phase. In August most birds moved north, some passing
through Bering Straits where observations at sea show they are in basic plumage. In
October-November the sample split into two groups, one returning to waters off
western N America (33%) and the remainder carrying on westwards to waters off
Japan, Korea and NE China. For the former group the movement to the Bering Sea in
June constitutes a moult migration and, as such, is the first described for an auk. The
Asian-wintering birds started moving eastwards in February and arrived off BC in the
second half of March, when observations at colonies show that burrow visits begin in
Haida Gwaii. Our data suggest that during their most vulnerable phase, immediately
after colony departure, birds from the east coast colonies (about half the population of
Haida Gwaii) are at higher risk than those breeding on the west coast from potential oil
spills in northern British Columbia waters.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Distinct stopover and routing behaviour of diurnally and nocturnally migrating songbirds has been stated in the 1960ies but empirical confirmation is yet lacking widely. We studied the behaviour of individual diurnally migrating dunnocks and nocturnally migrating blackcaps by means of large-scale automated radio-telemetry. Birds were radio-tagged during their stopover at the German North Sea coast. Our data indicate longer initial stopover duration in the diurnally migrating dunnocks, opposing the hypothesis of nocturnal migrants needing more time to recover due to their longer migratory flights. Nonetheless, dunnocks stopped over more often along their tracks as when compared to the nocturnally migrating blackcaps. Behaviour en route did not differ as clearly between species challenging the general view of contrasting routings of diurnal and nocturnal migrants with regard to landscape and open water. Our results imply additional factors of relevance other than differences in species or daily migration timing per se. We discuss and highlight the need of detailed and individual based data to better understand stopover and routing behaviour of songbirds in the environmental context.",research,NA,FALSE,00:00.0,55:23.0,134437,"Prunella modularis,Sylvia atricapilla","Bird Ring,Radio Transmitter"

We assessed the importance of different landscape elements (open sea, tidal flats and inland) by comparing marine and terrestrial foraging behaviours in lesser black-backed gulls breeding along the coast of the southern North Sea. We attached GPS data loggers to eight incubating birds and collected information on diet and habitat use. The loggers recorded data for 10–19 days to allow flight-path reconstruction. Lesser black-backed gulls foraged in both offshore and inland areas, but rarely on tidal flats. Targets and directions were similar among all eight individuals. Foraging trips (n = 108) lasted 0.5–26.4 h (mean 8.7 h), and ranges varied from 3.0–79.9 km (mean 30.9 km). The total distance travelled per foraging trip ranged from 7.5–333.6 km (mean 97.9 km). Trips out to sea were significantly more variable in all parameters than inland trips. Presence in inland areas was closely associated with daylight, whereas trips to sea occurred at day and night, but mostly at night. The most common items in pellets were grass (48%), insects (38%), fish (28%), litter (26%) and earthworms (20%). There was a significant relationship between the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals in blood and the proportional time each individual spent foraging at sea/land. On land, gulls preferentially foraged on bare ground, with significantly higher use of potato fields and significantly less use of grassland. The flight patterns of lesser black-backed gulls at sea overlapped with fishing-vessel distribution, including small beam trawlers fishing for shrimps in coastal waters close to the colony and large beam-trawlers fishing for flatfish at greater distances. Our data show that individuals made intensive use of the anthropogenic landscape and seascape, indicating that lesser black-backed gulls are not a predominantly marine species during the incubation period.",research,NA,FALSE,41:20.0,33:02.0,49617,Larus fuscus,GPS

areas, is widespread in nature, and likely benefits individuals through higher foraging
efficiency and potentially, higher breeding success. It may arise as a consequence of
habitat or resource specialisation, or alternatively, where resources are abundant or
predictable, the partitioning of space might guarantee individuals exclusive foraging
opportunities. We tracked seven adult great black-backed gulls Larus marinus at a
North Sea colony from early incubation to the end of the breeding season in 2016,
providing a total of 1170 foraging trips over a mean ± SD tracking period of 67 ± 16
days. There was clear spatial segregation between individuals, with almost no overlap
of their core areas (50% utilisation distribution) during incubation and chickrearing.
Core areas were relatively small and there was high repeatability (R ± SE) in
foraging parameters, including initial departure direction (0.73 ± 0.11), foraging range
(0.41 ± 0.14) and cumulative distance travelled (0.19 ± 0.1) throughout the breeding
season. Despite the low spatial overlap, there was little evidence of differential habitat
use by individuals. The near-exclusive individual foraging areas of this species, usually
considered to be a generalist, indicate that where there is high resource availability
throughout the breeding season and a small local population, individuals appear to
adopt a territorial strategy which likely reduces intraspecific competition.",research,NA,FALSE,03:32.0,59:45.0,275521,Larus marinus,GPS

We present satellite tracking data on common cuckoos experimentally displaced 1,800 km eastward from Rybachy to Kazan. After displacement, both young and adult travelled similarly towards the route of non-displaced control birds. The tracking data demonstrate the potential for young common cuckoos to return to the species-specific migration route after displacement, a response so far reported exclusively in experienced birds.

We used three sources of information to evaluate the different hypotheses. First, we used genetic information obtained via feather samples from individuals of the three subspecies (S. a. aurocapilla, S. a. cinereus, S. a. furvior). In addition, quill mites (Acariformes, Syringophilidae) were removed from feathers and a fragment of their COI gene was sequenced to assess their species identity and population structure as possible reflections of host population structuring.  For two Ovenbird subspecies (S. a. aurocapilla and S. a. cinereus) we used light-level geolocators to quantify migratory paths and identify wintering areas. Paleo-hindcast projections from bioclimatic models of Ovenbird distribution were generated to identify potential locations of refugia for this species during the last glacial maximum as a factor explaining population genetic structure. We found relatively strong migratory connectivity within and among two subspecies, but little genetic support for the migratory flyway hypothesis.  Similarly, there was no difference in wing length and body weight between subspecies to support the morphology hypothesis.  Birds breeding in the Cypress Hills (S. a. cinereus) can be considered a distinct genetic unit, but there was no evidence of genetic differentiation or isolation by distance among all other subpopulations, providing most support for the panmictic population hypothesis suggesting that with the exception of those in Cypress Hills, Ovenbirds across Canada form one panmictic population.  There was also very limited genetic variation among the syringophilid mites, indicating that Ovenbird movements can maintain gene flow in symbiont populations.  These results are consistent with predictions from paleo-hindcast distribution models from two different global climate models indicating a continuous single refugium 21,000 years BP (ca. Last Glacial Maximum), with the possibility of a separate refugium for S. a. cinereus vs. other subspecies.  Our results suggest that two of the three Ovenbird subspecies are defined by criteria that can be considered arbitrary and may not provide a strong model for setting population management units.

Tøttrup,"Protandry, the earlier arrival of males at the breeding grounds relative to females, is common in migratory birds. However, due to difficulties in following individual birds on migration, we still lack knowledge about the spatiotemporal origin of protandry during the annual cycle, impeding our understanding of the proximate drivers of this phenomenon. Here, we use full annual cycle tracking data of red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio to investigate the occurrence of sex-related differences in migratory pattern, which could be viewed as precursors (proximate causes) to protandry. We find protandry with males arriving an estimated 8.3 days (SE = 4.1) earlier at the breeding area than females. Furthermore, we find that, averaged across all departure and arrival events throughout the annual cycle, males migrate an estimated 5.3 days earlier than females during spring compared to 0.01 days in autumn. Event-wise estimates suggest that a divergence between male and female migratory schedules is initiated at departure from the main non-breeding area, thousands of kilometres from, and several months prior to arrival at the breeding area. Duration of migration, flight speed during migration and spatial locations of stationary sites were similar between sexes. Our results reveal that protandry might arise from sex-differential migratory schedules emerging at the departure from the main non-breeding area in southern Africa and retained throughout spring migration, supporting the view that sex-differential selection pressure operates during spring migration rather than autumn migration.",research,NA,FALSE,35:00.0,21:00.0,18511,Lanius collurio,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw,Solar Geolocator Twilight"

Using the smallest available geolocator, we aim to map autumn migration and wintering areas of north European wood warblers Phylloscopus sibilatrix and compare the spatiotemporal pattern with recoveries of individuals ringed across Europe.
Results: A tracked wood warbler migrated south-south-east to sub-Saharan Africa in Sudan and then west-south-west to winter in Côte d’Ivoire. The timing and route fits well within the distribution of ring recoveries although the westward movement after the Sahara crossing is not revealed by the ring recoveries, but only few recoveries south of Sahara exist.
Conclusions: The surprising westward movement south of the Sahara supplements the overall pattern revealed by ring recoveries and aids our understanding of the connectivity and site dependence in this generally declining species.",research,NA,FALSE,49:00.0,24:00.0,404,Phylloscopus sibillatrix,"Solar Geolocator,Solar Geolocator Raw"

Summers,"The number of breeding common sandpipers has declined in Britain due to poorer return rates from non‐breeding areas. To investigate little known aspects of their annual cycle, breeding common sandpipers were fitted with geolocators to track their migrations and determine their non‐breeding areas. Ten tagged birds left Scotland on 9 July (median dates and durations are given throughout the abstract). Short‐term staging was carried out by some birds in England and Ireland, then for longer by most birds in Iberia before continuing to West Africa, arriving on 28 July. Six birds spent most of the non‐breeding season (October–February) on the coast of Guinea‐Bissau, suggesting that this is a key area. Single birds occurred in Sierra Leone, Guinea, the Canary Islands and Western Sahara. The southward migration from Scotland took 17.5 days (range 1.5‐24 days), excluding the initial fuelling period. The first northward movement from Africa was on 12 April. Staging occurred in either Morocco, Iberia or France. Arrival in Scotland was on 2 May. The northward migration took 16 days (range 13.5‐20.5 days). The main migration strategy involved short‐ and medium‐range flights, using tail‐winds in most cases. Variation in strategy was associated with departure date; birds that left later staged for shorter durations. Coastal West Africa provides two major habitats for common sandpipers: mudflats associated with mangroves and rice fields. Although the area of mangrove has been depleted, the scale of loss has probably been insufficient to account for the decline in sandpiper numbers. Rice fields are expanding, providing feeding areas for water‐birds. Meteorological data during the migrations suggest that the weather during the southward migration is unlikely to contribute to a population decline but strong cross‐winds or head‐winds during the northward migration to the breeding grounds may do so.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,Actitis hypoleucos,Solar Geolocator Raw

Subsequently, they moved widely throughout portions of western and southcentral Alaska up to 750 km from their natal areas during fall and winter months. Transmitters of two birds (one male and one female) continued to send location data into their second year and allowed us to determine the location and timing of the flightless molt period for each bird. Overall, our data suggest that juvenile Common Mergansers range widely immediately after fledging, that second year males and females may differ in their movement patterns, and that these movements have implications for population genetic structure of this species.

Ultimately, this information will be used as part of the effort to estimate population growth rate and factors limiting growth of the KIMU population in Icy Bay.
Research Objectives
1. Estimate current breeding distribution and population size of peregrine falcons in the Icy Bay area and compare that to previous surveys, where available.
2. Describe the effect of predation by peregrine falcons on Kittlitz's Murrelets by quantifying the incidence of Kittlitz's Murrelets in raptor diets.

Migration is a prominent aspect of the life history of many avian species, but the demographic consequences of variable migration strategies have only infrequently been investigated, and rarely when using modern technological and analytical methods for assessing survival, movement patterns, and long-term productivity in the context of life history theory. We monitored the fates of 50 satellite-implanted tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) over 4 years from five disparate breeding areas in Alaska, and used known-fate analyses to estimate monthly survival probability relative to migration distance, breeding area, migratory flyway, breeding status, and age. We specifically tested whether migratory birds face a trade-off, whereby long-distance migrants realize higher survival rates at the cost of lower productivity because of reduced time on breeding areas relative to birds that migrate shorter distances and spend more time on breeding areas.
<br> <br>
<u>Results</u>: 
Annual migration distances varied significantly among breeding areas (1020 to 12720 km), and were strongly negatively correlated with time spent on breeding areas (r = -0.986). Estimates of annual survival probability varied by wintering area (Pacific coast, Alaska Peninsula, and Eastern seaboard) and ranged from 0.79 (95%CI: 0.70–0.88) to 1.0, depending on criteria used to discern mortalities from radio failures. We did not find evidence for a linear relationship between migration distance and survival as swans from the breeding areas with the shortest and longest migration distances had the highest survival probabilities. Survival was lower in the first year post-marking than in subsequent years, but there was not support for seasonal differences in survival. Productivity varied among breeding populations and was generally inversely correlated to survival, but not migration distance or time spent on breeding areas.
<br> <br>
<u>Conclusions</u>: 

Tundra swans conformed to a major tenet of life history theory, as populations with the highest survival generally had the lowest productivity. The lack of a uniform relationship between time spent on breeding areas and productivity, or time spent on wintering areas and survival, indicates that factors other than temporal investment dictate demographic outcomes in this species. The tremendous diversity of migration strategies we identify in Alaskan tundra swans, without clear impacts on survival, underscores the ability of this species to adapt to different environments and climatic regimes.

This study is the first to provide data on summer and winter ranges and migration distances. We highlight a behaviour previously unknown in Gyrfalcons, in which birds winter on sea ice far from land. During 2000–2004, data were collected from 48 Gyrfalcons tagged with satellite transmitters in three parts of Greenland: Thule (northwest), Kangerlussuaq (central-west) and Scoresbysund (central-east). Breeding home-range size for seven adult females varied from 140 to 1197 km2 and was 489 and 503 km2 for two adult males. Complete outward migrations from breeding to wintering areas were recorded for three individuals: an adult male which travelled 3137 km over a 38-day period (83 km⁄day) from northern Ellesmere Island to southern Greenland, an adult female which travelled 4234 km from Thule to southern Greenland (via eastern Canada) over an 83-day period (51 km⁄day), and an adult female which travelled 391 km from Kangerlussuaq to southern Greenland over a 13-day period (30 km ⁄ day). Significant differences were found in winter home-range size between Falcons tagged on the west coast (383–6657 km2) and east coast (26 810– 63 647 km2). Several Falcons had no obvious winter home-ranges and travelled continually during the non-breeding period, at times spending up to 40 consecutive days at sea, presumably resting on icebergs and feeding on seabirds. During the winter, one juvenile female travelled over 4548 km over an approximately 200-day period, spending over half that time over the ocean between Greenland and Iceland. These are some of the largest winter home-ranges ever documented in raptors and provide the first documentation of the long-term use of pelagic habitats by any falcon. In general, return migrations were faster than outward ones. This study highlights the importance of sea ice and fjord regions in southwest Greenland as winter habitat for Gyrfalcons, and provides the first detailed insights into the complex and highly variable movement patterns of the species.

Documenting movements and identifying areas used by raptors before they enter a breeding population is important for understanding the factors that influence their survival. In North America, juvenile Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) are routinely observed outside the species’ breeding range during the nonbreeding season, but the natal origins of these birds are rarely known. We used satellite telemetry to track the movements of juvenile Gyrfalcons during their first months of independence. We instrumented nestlings with lightweight satellite transmitters within 10 d of estimated fledging dates on the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska and in Denali National Park (Denali) in interior Alaska. Gyrfalcons spent an average of 41.4 6 6.1 d (range 5 30–50 d) in their natal areas after fledging. The mean departure date from natal areas was 27 August 6 6.4 d. We tracked 15 individuals for an average of 70.5 6 28.1 d post-departure; Gyrfalcons moved from 105 to 4299 km during this period and tended to move greater distances earlier in the tracking period than later in the tracking period. Gyrfalcons did not establish temporary winter ranges within the tracking period. We identified several movement patterns among Gyrfalcons, including unidirectional long-distance movements, multidirectional long- and short- distance movements, and shorter movements within a local region. Gyrfalcons from the Seward Peninsula remained in western Alaska or flew to eastern Russia with no movements into interior Alaska. In contrast, Gyrfalcons from Denali remained in interior Alaska, flew to northern and western Alaska, or flew to northern Alberta. Gyrfalcons from both study areas tended to move to coastal, riparian, and wetland areas during autumn and early winter. Because juvenile Gyrfalcons dispersed over a large geographic area and across three international boundaries, conservation efforts should focus on both regional and international scales.

Using light-level geolocation, we obtained three full annual tracks and one autumn migration track of male red-necked phalaropes caught during breeding in Scandinavia. These tracks confirmed expectations that individuals from the Scandinavian population winter in the Arabian Sea. Migration was accomplished in two to four migration leaps, staging for a few days in the Gulf of Finland (autumn) or the southern Baltic Sea (spring) and for up to a month in or near the Black and Caspian Sea (autumn and spring). In addition, travel speeds suggested that only the flights between the Baltic and Black/Caspian Sea are non-stop, and thus the birds seem to make additional short stops during the other flights. Stopover time in the Black/Caspian Sea is only 8-10 days in spring but up to 36 days in autumn, which is longer than expected if only used for pre-migratory fattening to cover the ca. 2000 km to the Gulf of Oman. After entering the Arabian Sea via the Gulf of Oman, birds dispersed over the entire presumed winter range.

This study highlights the importance of sea ice and fjord regions in southwest Greenland as winter habitat for Gyrfalcons, and provides the first detailed insights into the complex and highly variable movement patterns of the species.

Eighteen Dall’s sheep (15 females and 3 males) were captured with a net-gun and radiocollared in March of 1998 to the east and west of Anaktuvuk Pass. In the subsequent two years, additional Dall’s sheep were captured to replace those that had died or had radiocollar failure during the previous year (6 females and 2 males). During this study (March 1998 – March 2002), 69 radiotracking flights occurred and sheep were located in every month of the year. The length of time between radiotracking flights was dictated by scheduling (minimum of five days between flights to avoid autocorrelation) and weather.

Walruses winter together in the Bering Sea but females with calves and subadults summer in the Chukchi Sea using sea ice as a resting platform while feeding on the shallow sea floor; whereas most adult males remain in the Bering Sea where they use terrestrial haulouts for resting. The rapid retreat of sea ice in recent years is changing walrus summer habitat in the Chukchi Sea and may be changing summer distribution and haulout behavior, requiring that walruses haul out on land instead of ice. Oil and gas activity has recently increased in the Chukchi Sea, increasing the importance of improving our understanding of walrus movements, feeding behavior, and habitat requirements to develop effective mitigation measures for the conservation and management of the species. Satellite-linked transmitters placed on walruses near the communities of Little Diomede, Shishmaref, Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, and Barrow in spring, summer, and fall would provide information on movements, speed of travel, feeding areas, and haulout behavior. Working cooperatively with the Eskimo Walrus Commission and walrus hunters from these communities, we have designed a study to deploy satellite transmitters and conduct counts and observations of walruses on haulouts near villages in spring and fall. Traditional ecological knowledge will also be collected and integrated into the results. These data will provide information that will help answer important questions about walrus movements, feeding areas, haulout behavior, migration timing, and body condition that will improve our understanding of habitats important to walruses.

This information is needed to model the potential effects of off-shore oil and gas development, economic development of coastal areas, and the potential effects of a warming arctic. We used satellite telemetry (PTTs) to characterize migration and to identify wintering and staging areas of eiders that nested in: (1) northern Alaska (coastal barrier islands in the western Beaufort Sea between -149.940° and -145.941°; (2) western Alaska at Cape Espenberg (66.50°, -163.50°); (3) western Alaska on the YKD (61.173°, -165.597°); and (4) the Aleutian Archipelago. Wintering and stop-over locations of the most northern nesting population were in the most northern polynya (1300-1600 km from the nesting area) that predictably remained open throughout the winter. Birds from Cape Espenberg wintered to the south in open waters (400-700 km from the nesting area) and used the same general areas as the birds from the western Beaufort Sea and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Birds from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta winter in waters offshore from the marking location to open waters on the Alaska Peninsula.

This study is the first to provide data on summer and winter ranges and migration distances. We highlight a behaviour previously unknown in Gyrfalcons, in which birds winter on sea ice far from land. During 2000–2004, data were collected from 48 Gyrfalcons tagged with satellite transmitters in three parts of Greenland: Thule (northwest), Kangerlussuaq (central-west) and Scoresbysund (central-east). Breeding home-range size for seven adult females varied from 140 to 1197 km2 and was 489 and 503 km2 for two adult males. Complete outward migrations from breeding to wintering areas were recorded for three individuals: an adult male which travelled 3137 km over a 38-day period (83 km⁄day) from northern Ellesmere Island to southern Greenland, an adult female which travelled 4234 km from Thule to southern Greenland (via eastern Canada) over an 83-day period (51 km⁄day), and an adult female which travelled 391 km from Kangerlussuaq to southern Greenland over a 13-day period (30 km ⁄ day). Significant differences were found in winter home-range size between Falcons tagged on the west coast (383–6657 km2) and east coast (26 810– 63 647 km2). Several Falcons had no obvious winter home-ranges and travelled continually during the non-breeding period, at times spending up to 40 consecutive days at sea, presumably resting on icebergs and feeding on seabirds. During the winter, one juvenile female travelled over 4548 km over an approximately 200-day period, spending over half that time over the ocean between Greenland and Iceland. These are some of the largest winter home-ranges ever documented in raptors and provide the first documentation of the long-term use of pelagic habitats by any falcon. In general, return migrations were faster than outward ones. This study highlights the importance of sea ice and fjord regions in southwest Greenland as winter habitat for Gyrfalcons, and provides the first detailed insights into the complex and highly variable movement patterns of the species.

In this context, we study the ecophysiology of little auks (Alle alle), which are the most abundant seabirds of the Arctic, and acknowledged ecological indicators of changing marine ecosystems in this polar region. Via a long-term study of little auks breeding in East Greenland (Liverpool Land), in place since 2005, but also through specific experimental and modelling approaches, as well as through a panarctic network of collaborations, we test the following hypotheses: (1) Arctic climate change is impacting the trophic status, the foraging ecology, the reproductive output, the body condition and the multi-annual survival of adult little auks during the breeding season. (2) Ongoing climate change impacts the migratory ecophysiology of little auks in the North Atlantic. (3) Flight and diving energetics condition the functional ecology of little auks, among the world’s smallest diving marine homeotherms. (4) Climate change is generating thermal stress for arctic seabirds, with impacts on their reproductive performances. (5) Environmental contamination impacts little auk ecophysiology, behaviour and breeding success, with long-term population effects. (6). The pan-arctic seabird community functions as a natural monitoring network for both legacy and emerging contaminants. All of our work participates in the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme (CBMP) of the working group Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) of the Arctic Council, and therefore corresponds to the expectations of arctic peoples in terms of environmental research.

Nonetheless, thorough statistical treatment of Argos datasets is often jeopardized by their coarse temporal resolution. State-space modelling can circumvent some of the inherent limitations of Argos datasets, such as the limited temporal resolution of locations and the lack of information pertaining to the behavioural state of the tracked individuals at each location. We coupled state-space modelling with environmental characterisation of modelled locations on a 3-year Argos dataset of 9 breeding snowy owls to assess whether searching behaviour for breeding sites was affected by snow cover and depth in an arctic predator that shows a lack of breeding site fidelity. The state-space modelling approach allowed the discrimination of two behavioural states (searching and moving) during pre-breeding movements. Tracked snowy owls constantly switched from moving to searching behaviour during pre-breeding movements from mid-March to early June. Searching events were more likely where snow cover and depth was low.

Along the migration flyway connecting breeding sites in the North American Arctic and wintering grounds in Europe or Africa, Nearctic species are confronted with significant barriers such as the Atlantic Ocean and the Greenland icecap. Using geolocation devices, we identified wintering areas used by Ringed Plovers nesting in the Canadian High-Arctic and investigated migration strategies used by these Nearctic migrants along the transatlantic route. The main wintering area of the Ringed Plovers (n = 20) was located in Western Africa. We found contrasting seasonal migration patterns, with Ringed Plovers minimizing continuous flight distances over the ocean in spring by making a detour to stop in Iceland. In autumn, however, most individuals crossed the ocean in one direct flight from Southern Greenland to Western Europe, as far as Southern Spain. This likely resulted from prevailing anti-clockwise winds associated with the Icelandic low-pressure system. Moreover, the plovers we tracked largely circumvented the Greenland icecap in autumn, but in spring, some plovers apparently crossed the icecap above the 65°N. Our study highlighted the importance of Iceland as a stepping-stone during the spring migration and showed that small Nearctic migrants can perform non-stop transatlantic flights from Greenland to Southern Europe.

Migratory divides exist for many birds, however for many taxa it is unclear where such boundaries lie, and to what extent these affect the connectivity of species breeding across their ranges. Sabine’s gulls (Xema sabini) have a patchy, circumpolar breeding distribution and overwinter in two ecologically similar areas in different ocean basins: the Humboldt Current off the coast of Peru in the Pacific, and the Benguela Current off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia in the Atlantic. We used geolocators to track Sabine’s gulls breeding at a colony in the Canadian High Arctic to determine their migratory pathways and wintering sites. Our study provides evidence that birds from this breeding site disperse to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans during the non-breeding season, which suggests that a migratory divide for this species exists in the Nearctic. Remarkably, members of one mated pair wintered in opposite oceans.

This study is the first to provide data on summer and winter ranges and migration distances. We highlight a behaviour previously unknown in Gyrfalcons, in which birds winter on sea ice far from land. During 2000–2004, data were collected from 48 Gyrfalcons tagged with satellite transmitters in three parts of Greenland: Thule (northwest), Kangerlussuaq (central-west) and Scoresbysund (central-east). Breeding home-range size for seven adult females varied from 140 to 1197 km2 and was 489 and 503 km2 for two adult males. Complete outward migrations from breeding to wintering areas were recorded for three individuals: an adult male which travelled 3137 km over a 38-day period (83 km⁄day) from northern Ellesmere Island to southern Greenland, an adult female which travelled 4234 km from Thule to southern Greenland (via eastern Canada) over an 83-day period (51 km⁄day), and an adult female which travelled 391 km from Kangerlussuaq to southern Greenland over a 13-day period (30 km ⁄ day). Significant differences were found in winter home-range size between Falcons tagged on the west coast (383–6657 km2) and east coast (26 810– 63 647 km2). Several Falcons had no obvious winter home-ranges and travelled continually during the non-breeding period, at times spending up to 40 consecutive days at sea, presumably resting on icebergs and feeding on seabirds. During the winter, one juvenile female travelled over 4548 km over an approximately 200-day period, spending over half that time over the ocean between Greenland and Iceland. These are some of the largest winter home-ranges ever documented in raptors and provide the first documentation of the long-term use of pelagic habitats by any falcon. In general, return migrations were faster than outward ones. This study highlights the importance of sea ice and fjord regions in southwest Greenland as winter habitat for Gyrfalcons, and provides the first detailed insights into the complex and highly variable movement patterns of the species.

Here we provide information collected from 1993–2005 on what we believe is a recently established and expanding population of High Arctic nesting Peregrines in the area associated with climate change. From 1979 to 2005, the average of the mean monthly temperature, minimum monthly temperature, and maximum monthly temperature for the five-month period, May through September, increased 1.1, 0.5, and 1.6 °C, respectively. Forty-one breeding attempts were recorded at six sites from 1993 to 2005 for this new population. Satellite transmitters were used to determine the home ranges and seasonal movements of female Peregrines, with adults traveling an average of 10,794 km at a rate of 205 km/day on outward migration. During outward migration, the maximum distance traveled by any female on one day was 1,349 km with the maximum total outward and return migrations for single individuals 12,438 and 11,071 km, respectively, to and from south America. Comparisons with Peregrine populations in Greenland at 67° N and 60.5° N, approximately 1,100 (Kangerlussuaq) and 1,700 (south Greenland) km south of the Pituffik area, respectively, show differences in various aspects of ecology. Based on a lack of both morphological and genetic differences it appears the Pituffik area population is likely a result of the extension of more southern breeding Peregrines moving north and taking advantage of an ameliorating climate and lengthened breeding window. Should climatic amelioration continue, the species may eventually expand its range into the very northernmost land area, Peary Land.

Scheiber, PhD MSc","The daily or seasonal release of hormones is essential for synchronising biochemical, physiological or behavioural processes. Different hormones interact with each other at various levels; therefore, examining only one hormone separately will lead to an incomplete picture. No single hormone has a one-to-one relationship with any particular behaviour, and neither is any behaviour regulated by only one hormone. One main goal here is to gain a more complete understanding of the relationships between three rhythmic hormones and their influence on daily and seasonal activity at the individual level. This is highly relevant as mistimed biological clocks or deviations of a body’s own rhythm may cause health problems. The Kongsfjorden barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) colony, one of the best studied bird colonies worldwide, will serve as a model system. These geese have been investigated comprehensively for decades, therefore 2/3 of them are individually ringed. In the summer, they breed in the High Arctic (Spitzbergen, Norway, 78°55’N, 12°15’E), overwinter in a well-defined area in Scotland, and their spring and fall migration routes are known. Furthermore, all necessary technology and laboratory analyses to be applied are at hand. 
	As the major product of avian clocks, melatonin controls the sleep-wake cycle and other daily activities (feeding, rest) along with seasonal activities (e.g. hibernation, moult, migration and reproduction). The release of melatonin is controlled by daily changes of light and darkness: light causes an inhibition, but darkness triggers secretion, resulting in increased levels. Finally, melatonin triggers the regulation of other rhythmic hormones, such as prolactin and corticosterone. Besides other functions, all three hormones are released during the stress response, an elemental physiological task. The relationship between melatonin and the light-dark cycle is clearly defined in temperate latitudes, but above the Arctic and below the Antarctic circle (66°N/S), where 24-hours of daylight prevail in the summer, but 24-hours of darkness in the winter, this relationship is less clear, but it is fascinating for studying the effects of time and rhythmical phenomena of life processes. Indeed, the results so far are ambivalent: in some species the rhythm of melatonin secretion and associated physiological and behavioral processes are lost whereas other species retain them. we have recently demonstrated the presence of an intact, but phase-shifted circadian pattern in corticosterone excretion in Arctic barnacle goslings, I will for the first time examine, how the three hormones behave under polar summer light conditions in individual geese, and if and how they are associated with activity. It is also new to continue data collection by tracking those geese throughout the year to assess seasonal adaptations and relationships of the three hormones and biologically relevant events, such as during migration when on the wintering grounds.",research,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We are providing the summary information from the state space modeling (SSM), not the raw tracking data. When gaps of many days occur in the raw data, the resulting track becomes less informed by data and thus less reliable the longer the gap is. Thus, we split individual tracks with gaps longer than 25 days, and we passed these tracks to the SSM as if they were separate individuals.
